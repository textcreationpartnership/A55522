            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the bleſſed ſucceſſe of an Army depends (after the favour of God) upon the election of a wiſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Generall; ſo doth the ſufficiency of the works of a Gariſon depend upon the choice of a skilfull Enginier. And the want of this choice hath been hitherto the eſſentiall cauſe, that ſew or none of our Gariſons have been fortified, as they ought to be; and why divers of them have been loſt in eight and fourty hours. Therfore to prevent this evil for the future, I intend, in the firſt place, to ſpeak of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities required in a good Enginier, That the Committees of our Gariſons, to whom this choiſe appertaineth, may be informed of them, to the end, they may hereafter be more circumſpect in their election.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is to be religious; for<note n="b" place="margin">Eccleſ. 2 15.</note> 
                  <hi>the fear of the Lord is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He is to be a ſouldier; for none can better judge of the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency or inſufficiency of Fortifications, then they that have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their youth to defend, and to take them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is to be a traveller; for he that hath not ſeen variety of works, and the excellency of forreign Fortifications, cannot perceive the defects of ours, nor give directions to rectifie them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is to be well verſed in the Arithmetike for his calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; in the Geometry, for the ſetting out of all ſuperficies; in the Architecture, for to direct all manner of artificers; and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101578:7"/>parts of the Mathematikes, for the taking of diſtances depths, and elevations, and for the inventing and the contriving of all manner of Engines and machines of warre.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He is to be wiſe in all his proceedings, punctuall in all his promiſes, carefull and diligent in his calling, and rather enclined to auſterity then lenity, or otherwiſe he will never be reſpected, ſerved or obeyed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He is to be of a ſolid judgement, and quick of apprehenſion, to judge aright of the defects and advantages of places, of raiſing grounds, or hollows that may endanger, or command a place committed to his truſt, and what kinde of method of Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is moſt convenient for it; and which method, among the reſt, requires leſſe men to man the works; or to judge of the weakeſt places of a Gariſon, if he be deſired by his Generall to goe with him to beſiege a Town, adviſing him where he is to begin his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, plant his batteries, where he is to erect his bridges, if there be a river running of one ſide, or in the midſt of the Town, and how the line of communication is to be drawn to ſecure his bridges; and what redoubts or flankers are required to fortifie his Camp. He is not to give account of his actions to any, but to the Generall, or to the lieutenant Generall of the Ordnance; if he be in an Army, or in a Gariſon, only to the grand Committee, and to the Governour; and as for all other kinde of men, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſouldiers or officers; he is not bound to expoſtulate the caſe, if they demand of him reaſons for any thing he directs or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to be done; neither ought he, if he regards his reputation, and makes conſcience of his ways, to comply (when he is called to a Councel of war, or before a full or whole Committee) with the humour of the greateſt in authority, or be led to aſſent to any reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that is againſt the maxims of his Art, by the Logical and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticall reaſons and arguments of Scholars or Church-men; for ſome of them are now a dayes over-buſie in things that go beyond their element, and endeavour to over-ſway Artiſts by rhetorike, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering not that their reaſons are no reaſons at all to the reaſons of art. And this laſt quality is the eſſentiall part of a good Enginier; for all the other are but to ſmall purpoſe without this.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Nations that have excelled, and doe excell at this preſent time, all other Nations in the Art of Fortification.</head>
               <p>IT is certain that the <hi>Caldeans, Jews, Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> have anciently excelled all other Nations in the art of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and aſſailing: And that the <hi>Italians,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> do at this day excell all others in theſe Arts. M. <hi>Ward</hi> in his Animadverſions of warre, is pleaſed to give the precedency to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> yet I know no reaſon for it, except it be to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that Nation, where he exerciſed his <hi>Militia.</hi> For if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> excell theſe two former Nations in their out-guards, they do as much excell them in their inward works; and all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giniers know, that the inward works are the eſſentiall parts of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101578:8"/>the Art of Fortification. And yet of late years S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Anthony de Ville,</hi> and <hi>Honorat de Meynier,</hi> two of the laſt <hi>French</hi> Kings En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giniers, have gotten in my opinion the ſtart of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> for out-works, and avant-guards alſo. Notwithſtanding they have the moſt convenient ſoil for ſuch works, of any Nation in Chriſtendom, becauſe twenty Pioneersin <hi>Holland,</hi> will do more work in one day, then threeſcore can do here in <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> in two dayes, for the evenneſſe of their ſoil, the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their ground, and their plenty of turff. But if the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in theſe Arts belong to any of theſe three Nations, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains really to the <hi>Italians,</hi> for <hi>John Baptist Zanche, Caſtriot Durbin, Francis Montemeillino, Lorini Florentine,</hi> and <hi>Peter Sardi</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> and divers other <hi>Italian</hi> Enginiers, ſome of which comming with the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> into the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, infuſed in the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> what they know of theſe Arts, for they were the firſt that revived and adorned them, after they had been buried for divers centuries of years, in the grave of oblivion, by the inhumanity of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</hi> I do not here place the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> to ſtand in competition with theſe three Nations, becauſe the greater part of the beſt Fortifications in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> have been lined out and ſurveyed by <hi>Italian</hi> Enginiers. Now, whether our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Fortifications do excell the Fortifications of the ancient <hi>Caldeans, Jewes, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> it cannot be decided, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theirs are deſtroyed, and ours extant; except we refer our ſelves to the teſtimony of the ancient Hiſtorians: which, if we do, M. <hi>Wards</hi> poſition, ſpoken of in the laſt Chapter, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrown. For although I have ſeen in my travels, the greater part of the rareſt and ſtrongeſt holds in Chriſtendom, yet I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, that I have ſeen none to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Towers and Rampiers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ejente, Syracuſe, Tyrus,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to the Cittadel of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and the three Towers, and the Rampiers, that <hi>Herod</hi> the great built in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of his wife, brother and intimate friend. And as for the Art of aſſailing, that goeth hand in hand with the Art of Fortification, as two inſeparable Twins or Companions; all ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men know, that as the one increaſeth in degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101578:9"/>ſo doth the other, becauſe if new inventions be found to fortifie places, more ſufficiently then one could formerly, the ingenious ſpirits of great Commanders have no reſt, till they have found new waies of aſſailing to reduce them. For inſtance, the invention of baſtions and motes of fourſcore, or of a hundred foot broad, and thirty foot deep, full of water, was no ſooner found out, but <hi>Gerard</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Enginier, that was in the ſervice of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> found the invention of our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, whereby theſe large and deep motes may be paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger, and mines made to blow up the baſtions. Whereby we may conclude, that if the ancient did excell us in the Art of Fortification, they did alſo go beyond us in the art of aſſailing. Now to prove that they did excell us in them both; we are, 1. To examine what modern Fortifications are extant, that may be compared to the ancient Fortifications before cited. 2. In which of all our modern ſieges, there hath been more art and induſtry ſhown, then at the ſiege of <hi>Alexie,</hi> and of that of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> But becauſe this point may more properly be decided, when we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of the art of aſſailing; I will paſſe it over at this time, to examine another poſition of <hi>M. Ward,</hi> that maintains, our Ordnance to be more powerfull then the great Machines of war of the ancients; and upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, that of neceſſity our Fortifications muſt be ſtronger then theirs were, becauſe ſome of ours can hold out againſt the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our roaring Cannons. Miſtake me not, I do not ſpeak of the Fortifications of this Kingdom, for I knew never a Gariſon of ours, whoſe works are only of Cannon-proof, but of the beſt forreign Fortifications. I acknowledge that the great Machines of war of the ancient where more comberſome to mannage then our Cannons are; but that our Cannons be more powerfull then they were, it doth not appear to be ſo by the teſtimony of the ancient Hiſtorians. For the great Rams of the <hi>Romans,</hi> made great and ſufficient breaches to come to an aſſault, in the ſtrong Rampiers and Towers of the Cittadell of <hi>Antonia,</hi> and in <hi>Herods</hi> Towers, that were built, ſaith <hi>Joſephus,</hi> of bard free-ſtones of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thicknes; againſt which, a battery of ſix of our Cannons could not have moved one of them. And in liew of our muskets, they had balliſters that were more powerfull, wher with they kept
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101578:9"/>the defendants in ſuch awe, that they durſt not peep out thorow the port-holes of their battlements. It is therefore moſt certain, that the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> have not only excelled us, in the Art of Fortification and aſſailing, but alſo in divers other Arts; as in the Art of graving, of painting, of ſculpture, of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, and in all the parts of the Mathematikes, and in the very art of warre. And as for the power of their Machines and balliſters, it was alſo greater then that of our Cannons, and of our musket-ſhot; only they were, as I have ſaid before, more comberſome, becauſe their great Rams required two hundred men to mannage them, and their balliſters four or ſix men: and ſix Cannoniers with their ſix mates, and four and twenty ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſes, will mannage ſix Cannons mounted upon a plat-forme, and every one of our ſouldiers can mannage a musket; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this advantage, they excelled us in the art of warre.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Of the true uſe of the Art of Fortification.</head>
               <p>THis Art was invented at the firſt, to preſerve a handfull of men againſt the oppreſſion and cruelty of a multitude; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of it, a Gariſon Town is not ſufficiently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, except one hundred men within it, can oppoſe a thouſand aſſailants without; and a thouſand, ten thouſand, that is, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant againſt ten aſſailants; but it is with this caution, that the place beſieged be provided with a competent number of men, ordnance, ammunition, arms, victuals, and a Magazine furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all manner of fire-works, morter-pieces, engines of warre, ladders, and pioneers tools; for if any of theſe neceſſaries be wanting, this Gariſon will not ſubſiſt againſt a leſſer number, then is here ſpoken of. But the Committees and Governours of our Gariſons, are for the greater part ſo careleſſe of theſe things, that few or none of our Gariſons are provided of victuals for a moneth, and of ammunitions, arms, fire-works, ladders, and pioneers-tools, ſo ſleightly, that the firſt aſſault would deprive
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101578:10"/>them of all their ſtore: nay, I have been in a Gariſon ſo ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in their timber-yard, there was not ſo much good tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as to make a draw-bridge, nor a ladder, nor barrows to be had, when occaſion did require to uſe them, but was enforced to ſtay while they were made. Now how ſuch a Gariſon could ſubſiſt againſt an active army, if it were beſieged, I leave it to the judicious Reader to judge of it. But our enemies are more provident, witneſſe the long reſiſtance of <hi>Baſing,</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi>-houſe, of <hi>Carlile,</hi> of <hi>Skipton,</hi> and <hi>Scarborrow</hi>-Caſtle, and now of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It was invented to preſerve a ſmall Army in the field, againſt a great and powerfull army, or of an army againſt three armies. As<note n="l" place="margin">See <hi>Caeſar</hi> Comment. of the warre of <hi>Africa.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> did preſerve himſelf, and the ſmall army he had with him in <hi>Africa,</hi> againſt the three powerfull armies of King <hi>Juba,</hi> of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and of <hi>Labienus;</hi> and by his great experience in this Art, did overthrow them all, more by the ſpade and pickax, then by his ſword. And one of the main ſecondary cauſes of the ſpining out of this unnaturall warre, hath been, that our Commanders in chief have neglected to make uſe of this noble Art, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf did not diſdeign to practiſe; for he often lined out the intrenchments of his own Camp, and would draw upon paper the models of the Forts, or Engines of warre, that he would have his Enginiers to ſet out, and have made. And for the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of bridges over<note n="m" place="margin">See <hi>Caeſar</hi> Commentary in the warres of <hi>Gaul</hi>
                  </note> Rivers, and raiſing of high mounts and plat-forms to place high wooden Towers, and his Machines of warre, he excelled all his Enginiers, as may be ſeen in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, by the ſtrong and ſtately bridge that he erected over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> when he paſt over into <hi>Germany,</hi> which bridge he fortified with four Forts, and rare intrenchments, to ſecure his return into <hi>France,</hi> leaving for the defence of them one of his Legions, and for the raiſing of incredible Towers, Mounts and Plat-forms, and for the ſetting out of an intrenched Camp, with a double line of Communication, I will referre the Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of it in another place, to the ſiege of <hi>Alexie</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where we may ſee his admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and skill in this Art. But we have ſhamefully been infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſundry times to raiſe our ſieges for want of an intrenched Camp, as at <hi>Newark, Dudley</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Pomfret</hi>-Caſtle, <hi>Banbury</hi>-Caſtle,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101578:10"/>and Dennington-Caſtle, and in all theſe by an handfull of men; whereas if we had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> in an intrenched Camp, an Army ſix times as great could not have forced us to a retreat. Therefore to beſiege Towns or Caſtles of any moment, without an intrenched Camp, except we come to a generall and furious ſtorme, the next day after our Army hath faced the ſame, it is properly to ſpin out this war wittingly; and for to receive rather an affront, then to obtaine a victorie, or honour and reputation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was invented to erect ſtrong holds upon the Frontiers of a State or Kingdome, to prevent the incurſions of a forraine Enemy, that might with a great Army, come like a roaring floud, that throwes downe all the river banks, into the verie heart of a Kingdome, without oppoſition, and by meere activitie conquer the ſame; as the Duke <hi>D'Alva</hi> conquered for the King of Spain, as unjuſtly as ſuddenly, the Kingdome of<note n="*" place="margin">See the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of Spain in <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Iſabels</hi> Raigne.</note> Navar, under pretext to paſſe thorow that Kingdome, to go againſt the French King, then in Languedock. And the eſſentiall cauſe of this great loſſe came by the negligence of the King of Navar, that had not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as he ſhould have done, with men, Ammunition, and victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, his Frontier Garriſon Townes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was invented to preſerve mens habitations, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of Corporations, and not for to burne, or pull them downe, as many of our Enginiers have done in theſe dayes, to their ſhame and guilt of conſcience. For if an Enginier, to comply with thoſe in authoritie, or with the ſelfe-conceited men of a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, aſſent to pull downe Suburbs, or ſmall Hamlets that are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Corporations, except they are ſuddenly and certainly in danger of a Siege, it argues that hee is either unskilfull in his profeſſion, or voyd of all Chriſtian charitie, and naturall huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; for by the experience of his Art, or alteration of his method of Fortification, he may preſerve theſe Suburbs or Hamlets, to the great advantage of the Town; or of another Fortification, and ſo diſpoſe of his works, that he may ſecure them, and yet the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration ſhall rather need fewer men to man their works, then it would require when theſe Hamlets are pulled downe. This hath been the caſe of Leiceſter, for had they not rejected a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, they might aſſuredly have been preſerved by a larger Line of Communication, then there was by halfe a mile; for this Line
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101578:11"/>might have been defended with three hundred men leſſe then that they made, for the which they were enforced to pull downe many honeſt mens houſes, and draw a true imputation of inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie upon themſelves; for what greater inhumanitie could theſe poore ſoules expect from their cruell Enemies, then to ſee their houſes burned, or pulled downe. And by this inſtance you may ſee how dangerous it is for Committees and Governours to be led away by the chat and ridiculous reaſons of ignorant and ſelfe-conceited men, that make no conſcience what miſchiefe they do to others, ſo they ſecure themſelves, as they ſuppoſe; for it is often rather a ſuppoſition, than a true ſecuritie or preſervation, becauſe it falls out oftentimes, that if theſe Hamlets or Suburbs be fortified, they ſerve as Bulwarks for the preſervation of their Towne, and ſo by pulling downe of them, they advance their owne ruine, to ſave ſome ſmall charges; nay, they often encreaſe them, by pulling of them downe. For inſtance: It is ſuppoſed by the judgement of ſuch men afore-mentioned, that Cotton End, a ſmall Hamlet adjoyning to the South bridge of North-hampton, is to be pulled downe, if they be threatened of a Siege, to make the circumference of their Works the leſſe, and to ſecure their Bridge. But I will maintaine that if Nature it ſelfe, and the Art of man had plotted together, to place a commodious ſeat to ſerve as a Bulwark, not only to the South bridge, but to the whole Towne, they could not have found out a better then that part of Cotton End is. For being fortified as it ought to be, it will make that ſide impregnable; and this End might have been fortified and ſecured at the firſt, with ſmaller charge and a ſhorter Line of Circumference, then that which they have made, by which it is expoſed to the Enemies mercie, and yet their Works are by it of leſſe validitie, if they had not relyed over-much upon their owne judgement.</p>
               <p>And although this conceit is backt with the aſſent of a earned Divine, yet I will judge charitably of his aſſent, as being in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo poſſeſt, this being out of his element; yet wiſdome ſhould induce him to rely more upon the judgement of an Artiſt, than upon his owne, and ſpecially when it is bent upon the ſafeſt and the moſt charitable courſe. And this counſell I give them, to fortifie only the ſaid End, according to the modell inſerted in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101578:11"/>the 23 Plate; now they may conveniently do it, will be worthy of thanks if they embrace it; but if they do not, if ever they be beſieged, it will produce an after-wiſh, as thoſe of Leiceſter did, when it was too late; O that wee had followed ſuch an advice and counſell: And ſo much for the diſcharge of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, it was invented to fortifie ſome places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in the time of a Civill War, that a whole Countie be not ruinated by a roving and plundering Army: But in this, the Committees of ſuch Counties are to be verie cautious in their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a ſeat, for all the head-Towns of Counties are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to erect Garriſons: And therefore I ſhall acquaint them in the next Chapter, of the beſt and of the worſt ſeats for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon: And will only for a concluſion of this point, informe them, that all ſeats of Garriſons, if they may be found, are to be as neare the middle of the Countie as may be, that they may the ſooner releeve all the parts of the Countie: And that by no means they aſſent to erect any more than one in one and the ſame Countie, that they may be the better able to fortifie, man, and provide the ſame to ſome purpoſe; for pluralitie of Garriſons in one and the ſame Countie, whether they are foes or friends, are deſtructive to a Countie.</p>

See pag. 35. and chap. 20.</note> a good Enginier is not to regard them, ſpecially if there be hollowes, and raiſing grounds within Cannon-ſhot of them; for it it is not the lining of theſe walls, or the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Mounts near or upon them, or the drawing of ill-lined and ill-flanked dikes within five or ſix yards of them that will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101578:12"/>the ſame. But a prudent Enginier is to let them ſtand, as a ſecond weake defence, to obtaine a parley after all is loſt, and yet not to rely on them, for they are rather deſtructive helps then profitable defences; But to draw his Line of Communication one hundred yardes or more into the field beyond them, to take in thoſe hollowes that will indanger, and hills or raiſing grounds that will command his Workes. Or if they be too farre diſtant from the walls, he is of neceſſity to erect well flanked Forts, or Redoubts to ſecure them, or all his Workes will not be worth a button; let his Workes be never ſo well carried up, or lined out. And theſe Forts are to have Corridors, or covered waves to retreat into, for to be relieved from the main Line of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, out of danger of the aſſailants ſhot: for a raiſing ground left out of the Line of Communication of Leiceſter, was the ſecondarie cauſe of the loſſe of it, and of a hundred townes more, if an abſtract did permit to produce divers like inſtances. And as for Mounts errected neare or upon old walls, they are of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſervice, then to hinder the aſſailants approaches, for a day or two; but when their approaches are made, they are of no defence at all, for having a raiſing ground within Cannon-ſhot, one may diſmount all the Ordnance upon them in an inſtant of time; and for the musket-ſhot, they are alſo of no uſe, becauſe the ſhot of the Musket doth not fly upon a levell line, but upon a deſcending line from a great height downwards, and ſo can hurt none except it be at point-blanke, but upon a levell line, if the bullet miſſe one, it will hit another, and what is ſaid here of the musket-ſhot, it may be applyed to the Cannon-ſhot, for if the aſſaylants had no raiſing ground to diſmount the Cannons pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon theſe Mounts, their Cannon-ſhot cannot offend them, when their approaches are within one hundred yards of theſe Mounts, for it is the long diſtance that giveth a level line to the Cannon-ſhot, when it is mounted ſo high. And as for the lining of old walls and the making of dikes ſo neare them, they are diſtructive wayes for the defendents: For the firſt, the earth and walls doth never bind together, but falls and helpes to fin and levell the town dike upon the firſt ſtorme of the Cannon-ſhot that is ſhot againſt the walls. And as for the ſecond, the very ſplinters of the wall during a Cannon ſtorme will drive the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101578:12"/>defendents from the Breſt-Workes of theſe dikes, that are ſo near the Walls, to a ſhamefull deſertion of them, to ſave their lives, and ſo they will become by accident a verie ſafe intrenchment for the aſſayllants, and ſo much be it ſpoken upon this ſubject for them, to whom it concerneth.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the forraigne Fortifications and Dimenſions.</head>
               <p>THe greater part of the forraigne Fortifications are not for our imitation, becauſe they require a long time to erect them, and more men then we have, or are able to pay, to maintaine and defend them, and more means to finiſh them, then we have at this preſent, the meanes of this Nation having beene exhauſted, by this unnaturall warre: Therefore I will omit to ſpeak of their Cavalliers, Faulſes, Brayes, Tenailles, Horne-works and Out-works of their Ravellins, and Corridors, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered wayes, as being altogether unuſefull for us, for the reaſons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101578:13"/>above expreſſed. Yet to ſatisfie the curioſity of the reader, I will treat of two of their methods of Fortifications, by Baſtions without, and with Orillons, and of the dimenſions &amp; proportions they obſerve in them, that the Reader may the better judge, whether theſe chargeable works are convenient for us, or no. I will alſo ſpeak of another of their Methods of Fortification by Avant Guards, newly invented by <hi>Honnorat de Maynier,</hi> a rare French Enginier, that would be as chargeable as any of the other two, if we did not reduce it to ſhorter dimenſions, and wholly omit the coſtly Free-ſtone Works they adorne them withall. And I do it the rather, becauſe this kind of method (above all others) is more capable of dimintion in her proportion, and be little or nothing at all the worſe.</p>
               <p>But I will (in the faſt place) repreſent unto you the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dimenſions of the two methods by Baſtions without, and with Orillons, that have no difference at all in their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and dimenſions, but only in the Line of the Flanks, and in the turning and framing of the Orillons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the dikes of theſe two Methods are ordinarily between foureſcore or fiveſcore foot broad, and their depth about twentie five, or thirtie foot deep.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they have another ſmaller dike in the middeſt of theſe great dikes, if in caſe they be drie, calied <hi>La Cunette,</hi> that is ſome foure and twentie foot broad, and twelve or ſixteen foot deep; this ſmall dike is commonly full of water in all places; for the raine-water deſcending from the Rampiers, and the ſides of the great dike, fill it, although the ground be voyd of ſprings; this ſmall dike is verie uſefull, for it preſerves the Garriſon from being ſcaled, or ſurprized in the night time, for the undertakers cannot paſſe the ſame without they caſt a caſting-bridge over it, and that cannot be done without noyſe, and this noyſe waketh the Sentinells, and alarmes the Garriſon; and with the earth of this dike they commonly make their Counterſcarp breſt-work, adorning the ſame within ſide with turfe, and one foot ſlope, the reſt being laid or ſpread aſlope, till it come to nothing, and even with the firme ground; that the French call <hi>Glacis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, their Rampiers are commonly foureſcore or fiveſcore foot broad in the bottome, with a ſlope on both ſides of two foot
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101578:14"/>or a yard high; but on the wall ſide it cometh no lower than the boltill of the ſtone walls, that the French call <hi>Cordeau:</hi> for upon that boltill they ſet their battlements of their wall, that are about five or ſix foot high, having a Port-hole at every two yards, and three foot from the <hi>Cordeau,</hi> and by reaſon of the great ſlope, that the Rampier hath, a way of ſome eight foot broad is preſently formed, that runneth between the battlements of the wall, and the Rampier, that is called the way of the rounds, and in French <hi>Le chemin des rondes,</hi> and this way goeth from one Baſtion to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, round about the Garriſon; a very commodious and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes for the Rounds to go ſafe in the night, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by looking out of the Port holes of the battlements, if any appeares neare to their Counterſcarp or Corridor that are on the other ſide of their dike, and the Rampier beſides the Breſt-work upon it, is commonly ſix foot higher then the battlements of the walls, and the Breſt-worke ſix foot more; ſo that the ſplinters of the wall during a battery, cannot offend the ſouldiers, that defend the Breſt-workes of the Rampier.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Rampiers are commonly thirty foot high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the height of the Breſt-worke that is ſix foot high within ſide, for it hath a foot-ſtep of eighteen inches high, and two foot broad, and the whole height of the Rampier with his Breſt-worke, is within ſide thirty ſix foot, and without thirty three foot high, becauſe the top of the Breſt-work is carried three foot ſlope, becauſe it is alwayes twenty foot broad at top to be of Cannon-proof: and the Rampier beſides the thickneſſe of the Breſt-worke and the ſlope of the two ſides defalked, is alwayes forty foot broad on both ſides, on which they plant Elmes or Sicamore Trees, that in few yeares make very pleaſant and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die walkes, that ſerve in time of ſiege for a way for horſe, men, foot and carriages, to come to defend and relieve the Rampier.</p>
               <p>Fiftly the diſtance from the Center of one Baſtion to another is commonly from two hundred fifty yards to three hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Sixtly the faces of their Baſtions are ordinarily from one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards to one hundred twenty yards, beſides the turning of their Orillons that is about twenty yards.</p>
               <p>Seventhly the whole gorge of their Baſtions are from one
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101578:14"/>hundred yards, to an hundred and twenty yards, from out to out.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The breſt of their Baſtions are from 120. yards, to 130. yards.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And from the center of the Baſtion, to the point, or the utmoſt Angle of the Baſtion, from 80 yards to 100 yards.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The flanks of the Baſtions from 42 yards to 50 yards, that is divided into three equall parts, if they make Orillons; one part is allowed for the flank, and the other two for the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the framing of the Orillons.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Their curtaines are alwayes betweene 160 yards to 200 yards.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The Line of Defence, to be good for the defence of the musket ſhot, is to be from 220 yards, to 250 yards, at the moſt.</p>
               <p n="13">13 The ſlope of their Breſt-works without ſide, is one foot for every yard, if the earth be good;<note place="margin">Novv let the Reader judge, vvhether theſe coſtly Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be for our turn.</note> and within ſide a foot in two yards: but if it be a ſandy ground, or a running clay, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a foot and halfe without ſide, and a foot within, for a yard high.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the ſuperficies contained in the firſt Plare.</head>
               <p>SInce the Principles of Geometry are the very ground-work of the Art of Fortification, I judge it convenient to begin this Abſtract, by the demonſtrations of ſuch ſuperficies as are moſt commonly uſed in the practice of this Art.<note place="margin">Of Superficie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A Superficie is properly any kinde of forme demonſtrated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101578:15"/>upon paper, or upon the ground, incloſed with three lines at the leaſt, except it be the circulary forme, that hath but one circulary line, that begins at one point, and ends at the ſame.</p>
               <p>The point is a ſmall touch of the pen,<note place="margin">Of the Point.</note> that cannot be divided, becauſe it hath no parts, but is the beginning and end of all lines, and the center of all Formes. See Figure 1.</p>
               <p>A line is the continuance of a point that is incapable of diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note place="margin">Of Lines.</note> but in the length of it, it is diſtinguiſhed by divers termes: As, by the ſtrait line, in Figure 2. by the circulary line, in Figure 3. by the perpendiculary line, in Figure 7. by the parallel line, in Figure 8. by the diagonall line, in Figure 11. and by the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall line, in Figure 12. There are divers other diſtinctions of lines, but they are not uſefull in this Art.</p>
               <p>All Angles derive from the conjunction of two lines in one point;<note place="margin">Of Angles.</note> whether they be ſtrait, circulary, diagonall, or mixt with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of theſe. As Figure 4. is called a plaine Angle, becauſe two ſtrait levell lines, from one and the ſame diſtance, meet at one point, and a ſtrait perpendicular, and a levell line falling in the midſt of a ſtrait line, produceth an Obtus, and a ſtrait Angle, as in Figure 7. And two circulary lines meeting at one point, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a circulary Angle, as in Figure 5. And a ſtrait and a circulary line meeting at one point, produceth a mixt Angle, as in Figure 6. There are alſo divers other ſorts of Angles, ſome of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of in another place.</p>
               <p>The eighth Figure demonſtrates how to make a perpendicula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie line cut a ſtrait line given,<note place="margin">Of the eighth Figure.</note> and how you may cut that perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculary line in three parts, by three demicircles, to make up the line given, three parallell lines, without altering the compaſſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other diſtance but the firſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let a ſtrait line be given, then take the juſt diſtance of that line with your compaſſe, and ſet one of the points of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the right hand end of the line, and with the other point make a ſmall demicircle above; then remove the point of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe upon the left hand ſide of the line given, and with the other point make another ſmall circle, cutting the firſt; and where theſe two ſmall circles cut one another, ſet your rule, and draw a ſtrait line to the line given, and it will cut the ſame with a ſtrait per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularie line. Now to avoid all errour that might proceed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101578:15"/>from the miſ-placing of your Rule upon the line given, make but two other ſmall demicircles below the line, as you did above, and where theſe cut one another, put one end of your Rule, and the other, upon the upper cutting of the two ſmall demicircles, and draw a ſtrait line, and (of neceſſity) the perpendicularie line will be ſtrait, and without errour.</p>
               <p>Now to cut that perpendicular Line in two equall parts more, to make up the Line given, three parallel Lines, ſet your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe upon the juſt diſtance of the length of the perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie Line, then ſet one of the points of the Compaſſe, upon the lower end of the perpendicularie Line, and make a demy circle upwards, then remove your Compaſſe upon the upper end of the perpendicularie Line, and make a demy-circle downwards, then remove the point of your Compaſſe upon the Center-point, where the perpendicularie Line did cut at the firſt the Line given, and make the third demy-circle upwards, and this demy-circle will cut the other two in foure places, and where they cut, ſet your rule, and draw two ſtrait Lines, and theſe will make up the Line given, three perfect parallel Lines, as it is clearly demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in figure 8.</p>
               <p>The ninth figure ſheweth how to draw as many parallel Lines as you pleaſe, upon two lines,<note place="margin">Of the ninth Figure.</note> that are the upper and the lower lines in this figure. Firſt, let two equall lines be given, one below, &amp; another above, according to the length you deſire to have your parallel lines, then divide theſe two lines with your Compaſſe, in as many parts as you deſire to have parallel lines, and at everie diviſion make a point, and from everie point make a demy-circle above the upper and the lower given lines, then ſet your Rule up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them one after another, and draw as many lines as there is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-circles, and theſe will all be perfect parallel lines. Now if you will double theſe parallel lines, it is but to divide with your Compaſſe the juſt bredth of them in two parts, and at everie divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make a point, and to ſet your Compaſſe againe upon its firſt diſtance, and to cut your firſt demy-circle with it, and to draw as many lines, and you ſhall have as many more perfect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel lines as you had before, as it is clearly demonſtrated in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 9.<note place="margin">Of the tenth Figure.</note>
               </p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101578:16"/>upon a line given: Suppoſe the Baſe of the ſquare is the line given, now to make a perfect ſquare, and foure Scalene triangles of this line, you are to ſet your Compaſſe upon the juſt diſtance of the line, and to ſet one point of it on the right hand end of it, and to make a demy-circle, and to remove your compaſſe upon the left end, and to make another demy-circle, and where they cut one another, ſet your rule, and draw a perpendicularie line, then turne your rule, and draw a ſtrait top line, and joyne the baſe line with this top line, by two ſtrait lines, and you will have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſquare, and foure perfect ſquare ſcalene triangles, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in Figure 10.</p>
               <p>The eleventh Figure ſheweth how to make a paralograme out of two circles.<note place="margin">Of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Figure.</note> Firſt, ſet your compaſſe upon the demy bredth of the paralograme, that you intend to make, and then make a circle on the right hand then remove your Compaſſe-point upon the extreame of the firſt circle on the left hand upon a ſtrait line, and with the other point mark the Center-point of the other circle, then turne your compaſſe round, and you will have two circles whoſe extreams will touch one another, then ſet your rule upon the foure extreames of theſe two circles, and draw foure ſtrait lines; and where theſe lines cut one another, there is the foure Angles of the Paralograme, as it is demonſtrated in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure 11.</p>

               <p>AMong all other Superficies there is none ſo uſefull for the Art of Fortification, as the Triangles; and yet Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> in his <hi>Animadverſions of War,</hi> makes mention but of three ſorts, yet there are ſix principall ſorts of Triangles, from which all other mixt Triangles are derived; and theſe ſix ſorts may be all ſet out by the Circle, as it is demonſtrated in this Plate.</p>
               <p>The equilaterall Triangle deſerves the precedencie,<note place="margin">1 Of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and the beſt vvay to ſet out the ſame.</note> becauſe it is the only Triangle that can be fortified by Baſtions, for all her ſides are equall; the beſt way to ſet it out, is to ſet your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe upon the juſt diſtance of the Baſe of it, and to make two points with your Compaſſe, and to draw two Demy-circles, one from the right point, and the other from the left hand point, and where theſe Circles cut one another, make the third point, and draw three ſtrait lines to theſe three points, and it will produce a perfect equilaterall Triangle equall of all ſides.</p>
               <p>Some ſet it out by the Circle,<note place="margin">Hovv to ſet out the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle by a Circle.</note> dividing the Diameter of it in foure equall parts, and draw a ſtrait line upon the firſt quarter point, as the Baſe of it, and two lines more from the two ends of the Baſe to the top of the Diametricall Line of the Circle; but this way is not ſo perfect as the other.

After your Circle is made draw a ſtrait perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie Line Diametricall wiſe upon the Center of it to the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames of the Circle, then divide that laſt Line into eight equall parts, and draw a ſtrait line with your rule, upon the firſt point of the eighth part diviſion, from one extreame of the Circle to another, and that Line repreſents the Baſe, then draw two ſtrait lines from the two ends of that Baſe, to the top-point of the

               <p>Now I come to the 24. Superficie that containeth an Ovall,<note place="margin">Of the ſetting out of the Ovall.</note> and in that Ovall two long Rhombs, a Paralograme, two equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall Triangles, and foure Scalene Triangles. But becauſe I have already ſpoken of all theſe, the Ovall and the two long Rhombs excepted, I will begin with the Ovall, the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult of all other ſuperficies to be rightly ſet out upon paper, or in the field.</p>
               <p>To ſet it out upon paper, you are to ſet your compaſſe upon the ſcale of the third part of the length you intend to have the Ovall, and this third part is to be divided againe into two equall parts, and your compaſſe ſet upon that ſixth part: then make choice of your Center, and cut the point of the Center with two ſtrait lines, one of them perpendiculary-wiſe, and the other diametricall-wiſe: then ſet one of the points of your compaſſe upon the Center point, and with the other make a point upon the diametricall line on the right hand, and another point upon the ſame line on the left hand, then ſet the compaſſe againe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third part of the length of the Ovall, and ſet one of the points of it upon the right hand point, that repreſents the End of the third part of the line of the length of the Ovall, and with the other point of the compaſſe make a circle, then remove the point of the compaſſe, and ſet it upon the left hand point of the aforeſaid line, and make another circle and the two extreams of theſe two circles repreſent the length of the Ovall. Then remove your compaſſe and ſet one point of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lower cutting of theſe two circles, and ſet it at that diſtance, that having a point upon this lower cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of theſe two circles, it may conjoyne with a true
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101578:18"/>circularie line, the two upper extreames of the two circles, that being done, remove your compaſſe, without any alteration of the diſtance, and ſet one of the points of it, upon the upper cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the two circles, and with the other point of it, make a true circulary line, to joyne the two lower extreames of the two circles; and this being traced with a pen, will produce a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ovall, one third part longer then it is broad; ſome make it halfe as long againe, as it is broad, but the ſides are too flat, and the Ovall is by it more deformed, and not ſo ſeemly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as this is, demonſtrated in Figure 16.</p>
               <p>Now to make the moſt perfect Rhomb that can be made,<note place="margin">Of the ſetting out of the Rhomb.</note> you are but to draw foure lines dioganall wiſe, from the upper and lower points of the perpendicularie diametricall line, that cuts the two broad ſides of the Ovall, to the two points of the diametricall line of the length of the Ovall, and it will produce a perfect Rhomb, as in figure 18.</p>
               <p>And to make the two equilaterall Triangles, and the foure ſcalene Triangles out of the ſmaller Rhomb,<note place="margin">Of the ſetting out of the 6. Triangles.</note> you are but to draw four lines diagonall-wiſe from the two Ends of the firſt line that did repreſent the eighth part of the Ovall to the two upper and lower cuttings of the two circles, and theſe lines (with the two diametricall lines of the length and breadth of the Ovall already drawne) will produce theſe ſix fore-ſaid Triangles.</p>
               <p>And to ſet out the Paralograme,<note place="margin">Of the ſetting out of the Paralograme.</note> you are to divide the breadth of the Ovall into four equall parts, and the length of it into nine equall parts, and at every diviſion to make a point, and to draw foure ſtrait lines upon the firſt points of theſe two diviſions, and they will produce this Paralograme that is a ninth part lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then twice his breadth.</p>

               <p>THe firſt Circle of this Plate contains an Equilaterall Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle,<note place="margin">Of the ſetting out of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral triangle out of a ſquare.</note> a Square, and a Pentagon. And becauſe all the Equilateral Triangles that are ſet out by a Square have their two ſides longer then their ſquare by an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> part; I have drawne two demy-circles to ſhew where the upper Angle of the Triangle ſhould come to be perfect and equall of all her ſides, and that is where the two circles cut one another. As for the ſquare, it is more eaſie to ſet it out from without the circle,<note place="margin">Of the ſetting out of the ſquare by the inward ſide of the circle.</note> then from within the circle, becauſe it is more difficult to reduce the ſides of it to that ſcantling propoſed, if in caſe you ſet it out by the inward ſide of the circle, then it is if you ſet out by the out-ſide of the circle; for the diametre of the circle is of the juſt length of the ſides; but to take out a ſquare out of the inward ſide of the circle, the demy-diametricall line of the circle is to be one third part longer then when you make it by the out-ſide of the circle. But if you are not tyed to a ſcantling, then you may make as perfect a ſquare our of the inward ſide, as well as from the out-ſide of a circle, by dividing the two croſſe diametricall lines of the circle, into 6. equal parts and by drawing 4. ſtraight lines, cutting the foure firſt points of this diviſion in the foure ſides of the circle, drawing the lines to the inward extremes of the circle, and theſe lines wil produce a perfect ſquare.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſetting out of the Pentagon, you are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the circumference of the circle into five equall parts, and at every diviſion to make a point, then you are to draw five ſtraight lines from point to point, and theſe five lines repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the five ſides or baſes of the Pentagon: then you are to draw five other lines from the center point to the end of theſe five baſes diagonal wiſe, and theſe five lines compleat the five ſides of the five triangles of the Pentagon; and this being done, this ſuperficie is perfected.</p>
               <p>The other three Circles contained in this place are to ſet out
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101578:19"/>in every one of them a Poligon with different Angles: <hi>viz.</hi> The firſt a Sexagon, the ſecond a Septagon, and the third an Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; having all of them the Baſis of their Triangles of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall length, by the encreaſing the circumference of the circle of the length of one of the Baſes. And becauſe this is a point of great concernment to an Enginier, that may by the ſame know at an inſtant how many Baſtions the place will require, if he doth but know the true circumference of it, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe my ſelfe more clearly.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then that the ſix Baſes of the ſix equilaterall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of a Sexagon contain 250. yards a piece, that is in all 1500. yards circumference. And that you would ſet out a Septagon with ſeven Baſes that ſhould contain every one of them 250. yards a piece, you are then to adde to the demy-diametricall line of the Sexagon, a ſixt part more of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that it had before; and by this meanes the circumference of the circle will be able to afford you ſeven Baſes of 250. yards a piece, that is in all 1750. yards. The reaſon of it is, that the circumference of a circle containes three diametricall lines, ſo that you are of neceſſity to adde to the former demy-diametre line of the Sexagon, a ſixt part more then it had before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a demy-diametre is but the ſixt part of the circumference of a circle.</p>
               <p>And by this rule you may make all the Baſes of any Foligon from ſix Angles to twenty foure Angles, nay to eight and forty Angles if you pleaſe, of two hundred and fifty yards a piece, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alwayes to the demy-diametre as foloweth; To make a Septagon you are to adde the ⅙ part; to make an Octogon you are to adde a ſeventh part; to make a ninth Angle Poligon you are to adde the eighth part; and ſo as you goe on, the ninth, the tenth, the eleventh, or twelfth part. And as I have ſaid, you are to obſerve that courſe, till you come to ſet out a Poligon of eight and forty Angles. That I conceive would be ſufficient to fortifie the City of London on both ſides the water, with as large a Line of Communication as it hath at this preſent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at every two hundred and fifty yards diſtance an Angle, to forme a ſtrong, complete, and defenſible Baſtion. A farre

               </head>
               <p>BEfore I come to ſpeake of the Superficies of theſe five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, it will not be amiſſe to inform the Reader of their extent, continent, and dimenſions. And firſt of their extent.<note place="margin">Of the extent of Redouts.</note> All ſquare or circullary redouts are to bee of one hundred yards from out to out in their diametricall line, otherwiſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward continent will be too ſmall. But a Triangle redout is to have her three ſides of two hundred yards a piece, becauſe two equilaterall Triangles containe no more then a ſquare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their continent is to be ſo large,<note place="margin">Of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of redouts</note> as it may lodge a competent number of Souldiers for their defence, that is, two hundred men at leaſt, and every two men cannot have a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler piece of ground allowed them for their lodging then a piece of eight yards ſquare, that makes in all ſixty four ſquare yards; Now a redout of one hundred yards diametre, reduced in the forme of a ſquare, will contain but 10000. ſquare yards; out of which you are to defalke a third part, for the Rampiers, the place, and the ſtreets; and then there will remaine but 6667. yards for the lodgings; and this being divided by ſixty four yards, it will containe but two hundred and eight Soldiers lodgings, if two of them be lodged together in a chamber of 24. foot ſquare. And by this you may judge whether the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Redouts about the City of London are of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable extent, ſeeing moſt of them have not fifty yards of diametre.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for their dimenſions.<note place="margin">Of the bredth and depth of their ditches.</note> Their ditches are to be tenne yards broad, and five yards deep, and the ſlope of the ſides of theſe ditches are to be but one foot ſlope in three, that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the ditch may remain to be twenty foot broad, when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101578:20"/>it is fifteen foot deep, for the reaſons that will be ſhewn when I come to ſpeak of the contre eſcarpe: and the Rampiars their Breaſt-works are to be proportionable to this ditch.<note place="margin">Of the height and thickneſſe of their Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers.</note> The height of it within ſide is to be twelve foot high, and nine foot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; the ſlope of it within ſide is to be but one foot in ſix, and one foot in three without ſide; there are to be five footſteps of two foot broad a piece,<note place="margin">Of their ſlope within and without.</note> and of eighteene inches high a piece, that the breaſtwork may not be above foure foot and an halfe high, that is of a convenient height for tall and middle ſiz'd Soldiers to diſcharge eaſily their Muskets. The top of the breaſt-work is to be twenty foot broad,<note place="margin">Of their five foot-ſteps.</note> to be of Cannon proofe, and is to have a ſlope of three foot, and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the out-ſide of the Rampiar is to be but nine foot high, and within ſide twelve foot high, for by this ſlope the Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers can defend the very brim of their ditch, which otherwiſe they could not doe.<note place="margin">Why the ſlope of their top is to be a yard.</note> Moreover, this great ſlope preſerves the Works from cleaving in the midſt, becauſe all the raine water falls off from them into the ditch. And by theſe dirnenſions your Rampier with the five foot-ſteps will be foure and thirty foot in the bottome, and twenty foot at top: a very ſufficient Rampier to oppoſe a good battery.</p>
               <p>Theſe broad and high breaſt-works require to be brought up with bruſh or bavin wood, if you deſire they ſhould be of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; the ſmalleſt bavin wood is the beſt, and it is to be bound up with bands, and of ſome foure foot long, and ſome foure or five inches thick; the ſmalleſt end of the bavin is to lap over the turfe on both ſides, and the thickeſt end is to be turned toward the middle of the Rampier;<note place="margin">How the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers are to be lined with ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins.</note> and when you have laid foure rows of them, every end lopping one over another halfe a foot, you are to caſt in the midſt of the work, a row of ſuch bavins of ſix foot long, to ſerve as a key to binde all the reſt; and this courſe you are to obſerve ſo ſoone as your turfe is riſen to be eighteene inches high; ſo that in the height of a yard, there are to be two ſuch courſes of bavins, that is in all ſix courſes of bavins for a Rampier of nine foot high without ſide, and of twelve foot within ſide; for the laſt courſe of bavins is to be placed when your out-ſide is eight foot high, that there may be eight inches high of earth to cover the bavin wood. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101578:20"/>after every courſe of theſe bavins, before you place another courſe, halfe a dozen of the ſtrongeſt Pioniers are to ramme the earth ſtoutly, with rammers made of a three inch'd plank, of a foot ſquare, with a ſtrong ſtate faſtned to it. If this be but obſerved, you will have ſtrong and permanent works; but thoſe that will not goe to theſe charges, are to expect to have the greater part of their works to be repaired every ſpring, and theſe repaires will be as tedious, and almoſt as chargeable as to make new ones.</p>
               <p>Now when theſe ditches are finiſhed, and the Rampiers and their five foot ſteps perfected, and hay-ſeed ſown on the top of the breaſt-work, after it hath been raked and rammed, you are to erect your Contre eſcarpe after this manner: Your great ditch being twenty foot broad in the bottome, if in caſe it be dry, or if it hath but a little water, you are to caſt it out, and to make in the midſt of it another ditch, that the French call <hi>La cunnette</hi> of ſixteene foot broad and nine foot deep,<note place="margin">Of the <hi>Cunnette</hi> or ſmall ditch.</note> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a foot-ſtep of two foot broad on both ſides; and theſe foot-ſteps preſerve your great ditch from calving in, and ſerve in Forts for the footing of caſting bridges, to ſally in the night upon the aſſailants out of ſalley-ports made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe under the orillons of the baſtions; and this manner of double ditch all in one, is farre ſafer then theſe ſmall double ditches, having a bank of earth of ſome two foot broad left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, uſed and erected about the London Redouts. Now all the earth that is digged out of this ſmall ditch,<note place="margin">How a contre eſcarpe is to be made.</note> is to be caſt on the field ſide; and as it is caſt out, other Pioniers are to ſtand upon the brim of the great ditch, for to caſt the ſaid earth twelve or fourteene foot farther off into the field; and when this is done, and the ſmaller ditch perfected, then you are to make the breaſt-work of the Contre eſcarpe with this earth, adorning the inſide of it with turfe, and with a foot-ſtep of two foot broad and eighteene inches high, and the breaſt-work higher then that foot-ſtep by foure foot and an halfe.<note place="margin">Of the ſlope of the breaſt-work of the contre eſcarpe, that the French call <hi>Glacis.</hi>
                  </note> And having levelled even and rammed the top of the breaſt-work ſome two foot broad, you are to lay all the reſt of the earth ſo ſlope till it come to nothing, and levell with the firm ground; and this ſlope is called for diſtinction ſake, by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101578:21"/>French <hi>Glacis.</hi> And by this meanes a ſufficient and defenſible Contie eſcarpe will be made round about the Works of the Redouts twelve foot diſtance in every place from the brim of the great ditch.</p>
               <p>I have been the larger in the deſcription of theſe dimenſions, becauſe I intend that theſe very ſame directions, ſhall ſuffice once for all, for the two laſt methods ſpoken of in this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract; which in all parts are to be like theſe, if the erectors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have ſtrong and permanent works.

                  </gap>-work ſix foot high and ſix foot thick; but theſe dimenſions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of Art, for theſe reaſons:
<list>
                     <item>1. The top of the rigge of the lodgings of the Souldiers is to be covered by the height of the Rampier, which cannot be done if they be ſo low.</item>
                     <item>2. When a ditch and rampier require a ladder of 30. rounds to ſcale the ſame, it is more dangerous and difficult to ſcale and to ſtorm then when it requires but a ladder of 12. rounds.</item>
                     <item>3. When the ditches are ſo ſhallow and ſo narrow, they are preſently levelled with bavins, and one ſoldier helping another with a Pike, may eaſily get up on the Rampier, and the other with his Pike drive the defendants from the defence of the Rampiers. In a word, it were better to erect no redouts at all, then to erect any ſo ſleight, and to expoſe mens lives to danger after that manner, for ſuch a redout will be gained at an inſtant by a Storme. Moreover, there is to be a good Well, and two Ciſterns made of Free-ſtone, plaſtered with Tarris, to receive all the raine water that falls upon the tiles of the ſoldiers lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, that are to be built by long ranges, and not to exceed in height 12. foot when the rigge tiles are up, to be free from the enemies battery; and every roome of 24. foot broad, may be divided in two of 12. foot broad, and 24. foot long; in the one may be the two ſoldiers beds, their apparell and Armes; and in the other, their drink, victuals, fuell, and all other neceſſaries. And theſe ranges are to be lined out according to the forme of the ſuperficies of the redout; if it be a Triangle, Triangle-wiſe; if it be a ſquare, after a ſquare manner; if it be of a fift, ſixt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101578:21"/>or eighth angle form, the ranges are to be after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that a place be left in the midſt of the redout juſt after that forme of ſome 30. or 40. yards on all ſides, as you ſhal ſee it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in greater Forts, having three, or four, or five, or ſix ſtreets, according to their angles, to goe from the place to the Rampiers, becauſe all things in a Redout are to be as orderly carryed as in a Royall Fort, for all the difference that is to be betweene them, is in their extent, the Redouts extent being ſmaller then of a Royall Fort, or Citadell.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning the ſuperficies of theſe five redouts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in plate foure; the firſt being the figure 24. is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſquare ſet out by the out-ſide of the circle; the ſides of the ſquare are of one hundred yards a piece. It is fortified by foure halfe moones, whoſe baſes are of fifty yards a piece to agree with the foure angles of the ſquare, whoſe ſides flank the halfe moone, and the ſides of the halfe moones flanke them, ſo that a man cannot appeare at any point or ſide of it, but he may bee in danger of his life by the Muſquet ſhot.</p>

There is a ſmall redout erected a: Grays-Inne-lane end much like after this manner; but her extent is too ſmall, and her flanke inviſible; and therefore no better then a plaine little ſquare redout.</p>
               <p>The third redout is a demy-Paralogramme,<note place="margin">Of the third Redout.</note> half as long again as it is broad; it is ſet out by the foure extrems of two circles, and fortified by foure halfe moones, whoſe baſes are of 75. yards a piece, the better to flanke the Angles of the Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gramme that flanke the half moones; this redout for her extent requires three hundred men for her defence, for it containeth 150. yards in length and one hundred yards in breath; It is of a very convenient form to be placed before the comming in of a gate of a great garriſon Towne to command divers rodes, ſo

If the 4. ſides of this redout that are in this figure but one hundred yards a piece were of two hundred yards a piece, it would make a ſtrong and well flanked Fort, ſo the utmoſt angles of the Avant guards extended themſelves 60. yards into the field; and the breſt to be of fifty yards, the flanks twenty five yards, and the face of the Avant guards of fifty yards. The Royall Fort neare Iſlington is much after this manner, only the face of his Avant guards are ſquare, and doe not extend themſelves farre enough into the field, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo regular, nor ſo defenſible as this.</p>

               <p>THe ſmall difference there is between theſe two firſt Methods of Fortification, by Baſtions without, and with Orillons, hath induced me to joyne them into one; for they agree in all their eſſentiall parts, but in two things, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Line of their Flanks, and in the having or not having Orillons. Firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Line of their Flanks, Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cruſo,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> do make no difference at all between the Line of their Flanks;<note place="margin">Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is to be obſerved in the dravving of the line of the Flanks, vvhen you are to forme baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vvith, or vvithout Oril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons.</note> for in all their Modells and Superficies, they draw the Flanks of the Baſtions with, and without Orillons, all after one manner, that is, upon a ſtrait perpendicularie Line: But on the other ſide, they would have the ſide, or the Baſe, to be divided into eight parts, when they frame Baſtions with Orillons, and only into ſix parts when they frame Baſtions without Orillons, in both which points I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine they are miſtaken: Firſt, for the Line of their Flanks, if it be drawne as they propoſe, ſtrait and perpendicularie wiſe, the Flanks by this meanes are too much expoſed to the Enemies great batteries, and to the volleyes of their Musketiers ſhot, as ſoone as they have gained the Defendents Counterſcarp; and therefore to prevent this evill, I ſay it is better and ſafer to draw the Line of the Flanks of the Baſtions that are to be without Orillons, one eighth part more ſlope than ſtrait: As for inſtance, ſuppoſe the Line of the Flank to be fortie two yards, then are you (I ſay) to ſtraine that Line five yards and one quarter more ſlope towards the other Flank of the other Baſtion, then a ſtrait per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularie Line will afford; for theſe five yards make the ſhoulder of the Orillon, to jet more into the dike then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would do, being drawne ſtrait; and by this meanes this jetting out is a great ſafegard to the Flanks; for all that thick and maſſie peece of earth, of the ſhoulder with this jetty, muſt of neceſſitie be battered to duſt, before the Flanks can receive any hurt; whereas if the Line be drawne ſtrait, the Flanks lye open to the Enemies batteries, if the Baſtions have no Orillons, or this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101578:23"/>jetting ſhoulder to defend them. This is clearly demonſtrated in Plate 7, where the Pentagon fortified by Baſtions is deſcribed better then it can be in the Triangle, Square, or Ovall formes, So that I conclude, that the Line of the Flank is to be drawne ſtrait, when you intend to forme your Baſtions with Orillons; and more ſlope by five yards and a quarter then ſtrait, when you intend to ſet out, or forme Baſtions without Orillons.</p>
               <p>As concerning their dividing of the Baſe,<note place="margin">Of the error of dividing the baſe into eight parts, vvhen they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſet out Baſtions vvith Orillons.</note> or ſide of any Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, when they intend to frame Baſtions with Orillons, into eight parts; and only into ſix parts, when the Baſtions are to be without Orillons: I ſay it is ſuperfluous, except they will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate altogether the beſt Italian method; that is, firſt to divide the Baſe into ten equall parts, and to allow foure parts for the two Flanks, and the other ſix parts for the Courtine, which they divide againe into eight parts, to take their Line of defence from the ſeventh firſt part of it. But if they intend to follow the Low-Countrey method, they are not to divide their Baſe, but only into ſix parts, becauſe the forming of the Orillons doth not take or ſhorten the Courtine at all, as it will be clearly proved in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Fortifications of the Equilaterall Triangle by Baſtions with Orillons, demonſtrated in Plate 9.</head>
               <p>THe Equilaterall Triangle is fitter to be fortified by Avant-guards then by Baſtions, becauſe her Angles be ſo acute, that they produce theſe defects in ſome eſſentiall parts of her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, her Flanks are ſhorter, the face of the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons longer, and their Breſt narrower then they ſhould bee, and theſe defects cannot be avoyded, except the Line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence be defective, that all Enginiers are to ſhun, as the moſt eſſentiall part of all; and therefore I have had ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to make that perfect, rather then to amend the other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. The Angle of her Center is of ſixtie degrees, her
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:101578:23"/>Angle flanked of fortie five degrees, and her Angle flanking of 160 degrees; her three ſides are of 250 yards a peece, her cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of 750 yards, and her continent from out to out, of 26230 yards; and therefore fitter for a large Redout then for a Royall Fort, for when wee have defalked the third part of her continent for the bredth of the Rampiers, the Market-place and the ſtreets, there will remaine but 17500 ſquare yards for the houſes of the Inhabitants, to everie one of which cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in this ſmall continent, above one hundred ſquare yards, that is a peece of ground of ten yards ſquare on all ſides, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſcantling there will be 175 Inhabitants, that are according to the rules of war, to billet two hundred and fortie Foot, and a Troop of threeſcore Horſe, that is, for everie third houſe an Horſe-man, and for all the other houſes two Foot-men appece, or otherwiſe 350 Foot, and no Horſe-men; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent is too ſmall for to billet Horſe. But 350 Foot, with the Inhabitants, commanded by a valiant Commander in chiefe, may defend the place three months, againſt an Army of foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, ſo it be provided with all neceſſaries for a Siege.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101578:24"/>and then if you find them all of an equall diſtance, faſten ſmall lines about them, and have the Superficie of the Triangle traced by many Pioniers, with pick-axes and ſpades; but if any of the Angle-ſtakes are not equall, you are to amend the errour by the line.</p>

               <p>The Superficie of the Triangle being traced, you are to divide the three ſides into ſix equall parts, and at everie diviſion to knock in a ſtake: then you are to faſten a line to the Center-ſtake, and to ſtraine it Diagonall-wiſe towards the South-Eaſt and South-Weſt Angle-ſtakes, and ſtrait perpendiculary-wiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North ſtake, making the line thus ſtrained touch everie one of theſe ſtakes; and you are to ſtraine this line of 95<note n="*" place="margin">The diſtance from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to the point, is in this Triangle of 95 yards.</note> yards beyond theſe three Angles ſtakes, for it is the diſtance that is to be between the Center of the Baſtion of the Triangle, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt point of her Baſtions, and at this diſtance knock in three ſtakes, and they will repreſent the three exteriour Angles of the three Baſtions. Then faſten a<note n="*" place="margin">This Line is to be of 240 yards long, the juſt extent of the Line of defence.</note> line to the third ſtake of everie one of the ſides, and ſtraine it till it be faſtened one after another to theſe three Angle-ſtakes, and it will ſet out all the faces of the three Baſtions, and all the ſix lines of defence; then faſten a ſhort<note n="*" place="margin">This Line is to be fortie yards long, the juſt extent of the length of the Flank of this Triangle.</note> line to all the ſecond ſtakes of your ſides, one time after another, and ſtraine the ſame ſtrait perpendiculary-wiſe, till they cut the other lines that repreſent the faces and the lines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and where they cut one another, knock in ſix ſtakes, and they will ſet out the ſix Flanks of the three Baſtions and the three Courtines; then have all theſe things traced by divers Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, after you have faſtened lines as neare the ground as you can to them all.</p>
               <p>And that being done, you are to ſet out the ſix Orillons of the three Baſtions after this manner; divide the Line of the Flank
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101578:24"/>into three equall parts, and allow one part for the Flank, and in that part knock in a ſtake, and the other two parts for the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Orillon; then you are to advance the ſhoulders of everie one of the Baſtions beyond the ſtake that did repreſent the end of the Flank and of the ſhoulder, ſeven yards;<note place="margin">Hovv a perfect Orillon is to be ſet out in the field.</note> then you are to knocke in a ſtake, and to faſten a line of ſeven yards to the ſtake that repreſents the firſt diviſion of the Flank, and to ſtraine this Line parallel-wiſe with the former, and at the end of the Line to knock in a ſtake; then you are to divide the juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bredth that is between theſe two laſt ſtakes, that will fall out to be thirteen yards and a third part, and in that diviſion you are to knock in a ſtake, and to that ſtake you are to faſten a line of thirteen yards &amp; a third part, &amp; at the end of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrained upon a ſtrait line, you are to knock in a ſtake; then you are to faſten your iron tracing pin to the other end of the line, and to draw with the point of it a circularie Line from one ſtake to another, touching as you paſſe by the verie laſt ſtake that you knockt in, repreſenting the extreame, or the middeſt of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularie line of the Orillon; and by this meanes you will forme the Orillon perfectly, and verie round; and as you have ſet out this Orillon, ſet out all the other Orillons after this very minner: for this one direction will ſuffice once for all, for the ſetting out truly of a perfect Orillon.</p>
               <p>By the ſetting out of this Orillon, the truth of the former po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made in the laſt Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Baſe or ſide of any Poligon is not to be divided into eight parts, but only into ſix parts, whether you intend to erect Baſtions with, or without Orillons, becauſe the Courtine is not ſhortened at all by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Orillons; for the dike runneth between the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier of the Courtine, and the inward ſide of the Orillon, as it is clearly demonſtrated in this Triangle fortified by Baſtions with Orillons, the Courtine having the ſame extent as the other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle hath, that is fortified by Baſtions without Orillons, except you pleaſe to imitate (as I have ſaid) the beſt Italian method, that is perfectly ſet out in a demy Sexagon, in the laſt Plate of this Abſtract, where you ſhall find the Baſe to be divided firſt into ten parts, foure of which are allowed for the two demy gorges, and the other ſix parts for the Gourtine, which Courtine is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101578:25"/>againe divided into eight equall parts, that the Line of defence may be taken from the firſt diviſion of the eight equall parts. And this they do to encreaſe the bredth of the breſt and of the gorge of their Baſtions, that they may be more capable of a ſecond, or a third re-intrenchment, when the Flanks, or the points of their Baſtions are beaten downe; but theſe Baſtions erected out of a Baſe divided into ſix equall parts, are reputed here to have their breſt and their gorge already too ſpacious, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were ſuperfluous to make them larger.</p>
               <p>To conclude: The irregularitie of the Triangle cauſeth the dimenſions of her Baſtions to be theſe: The Flanks are fortie yards with the thickneſſe of the Orillons, the Courtines 166 yards, and two third parts, the Line of defence 240 yards, the breſt from out to out 90 yards, the whole gorge 80 yards, the face of the Baſtion of 120 yards, the Orillons 26 yards thick, and twentie yards long, jetting over the dike, that is a great preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Flanks; and the diſtance from the Center of the Baſtion to the point, is of 95 yards, the Orillons being ſet out: Then you are to ſet out all the dikes round about the Fort and Works, obſerving the dimenſions deſcribed in the Chapter, where is ſpoken of forraine Fortifications, caſting the earth of the dikes inward, to raiſe your Rampiers; and when all your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works are finiſhed, and the broad dike perfected, then you are to ſet out the ſmall dike called <hi>La Cunnete,</hi> in the middeſt of the great dike, that you may make with the earth of it, the Counterſcarp round about the Fort, according to the directions before deſcribed.</p>
               <p>But if in caſe your great dike be full of water, and that it is impoſſible to dig the ſmall dike, to get earth to make your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp breſt-work, you are to line the<note n="*" place="margin">Hovv to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvork of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp, vvhen the great dike is full of vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> great dike round about the Fort, at foure yards diſtance from the brim of the dike, and to dig that twelve foot diſtance a foot deep, and with that earth you are to erect the breſt-work of your Counterſcarp; that is (as I have formerly ſaid) to be ſix foot high, having one foot-ſtep of two foot broad, and eighteen inches high, being adorned on the in-ſide with good Turffe, and the out-ſide made ſlope to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and levell with the ground, ſo wne with hay-ſeed; and the twelve foot ſpace that hath been digged a foot deep, is to be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101578:25"/>levelled with an aſcent to the foot-ſtep of the breſt-work, falling towards the brim of the dike, that the raine-water may fall into the dike, and keep that ſpace and your works dry.</p>

In the Ancient Fortifications by Baſtions,<note place="margin">Of the upper and lovver Flanks of a Baſtion.</note> there was formerly low Caſamates to ſcour the dikes even with the water, for they were built ſo low, that a Cannon being mounted in them and pointed, ſhot upon a levell Line, even with the water of the dike; and theſe Caſamates were all vaulted with arches of free-ſtone, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two Port-holer, and two Demy-Cannons, in every one of them, their vault being ſome ſixteen foot ſquare, and they had a ſlanting deſcent from the gorge of the Baſtion with a door to come down to them, but becauſe they had no other light then the Port-holes, nor no other evacuation for the ſmoke, then the doore, when the Cannoniers fired their Pieces, they were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with the ſmoke in the vault, that they could not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly charge their pieces againe, but were inforced to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now theſe flanks being all open over head, the ſmoke of the Ordnance is ſuddenly evacuated: the uſe of the upper Flank is to ſcoure the face, and the points of the Baſtions in the time of a ſtorme, and to beat all along the Courtine. And ſo much will ſuffice once for all, concerning the erection and uſe of theſe lower and upper Flanks.</p>
               <p>Now I come to ſhew how you are to ſet out this Square in the field. If men could as ſoon and as eaſily ſet out a Superficie in the field, as they may upon paper, it were ſoone done; but this laſt requires a greater labour and care. You are then in the firſt place to make choyſe of your Center, and there to knock in a ſtake, then you are to ſtand cloſe to that ſtake, and turne your face full South, and then take your Demi-circle, and ſet the ſight of it upon the ray of 90 degrees, that is the Angle of the Center of the Square; then you are to have two men by you, one with lines and the other with ſtakes, and he with lines is to have a line of one hundred and<note n="*" place="margin">You are to obſerve, that this line of 180 yards, is the juſt demi-dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonall line and diſtance that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen the Cent r-ſtake and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the Square.</note> foureſcore yards, the one end of which line he is to faſten to the Center-ſtake; and when you have taken your Demi-circle, and ſet the ſight of it as afore-ſaid, you are to take with it, having your face turned to the South, the right hand ray of the Angle of 90 degrees, and when you have it, let the man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101578:27"/>ſtraine the line faſtened to the Center-ſtake along the ſaid ray, to the end of the line, and when he is juſt againſt you and the ray of your Demi-circle, let the other man knock in a ſtake at his feet; then turne your ſelfe, and ſet your Demi-circle to take the left hand ray of the angle of 90 degrees, and when you have it, let the man with the end of the line come to it, and when hee is juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you and the ray of your Demi-circle, let the other man with ſtakes knock in a ſtake at his feet at the end of the line, and theſe two ſtakes repreſent the South-Eaſt and the South-Weſt Angles of your Square; then turne your ſelfe fall North, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cloſe to the Center-ſtake, and ſet out after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the North-Eaſt and North-Weſt Angles of your Square, and let the man with ſtakes knock in two ſtakes, as hee did in the South ſide, and theſe foure utmoſt ſtakes will repreſent the foure Angles of the Square. Now to avoyd errour, you are to faſten the line of 250 yards with a loop faſtened in the middeſt, on the South-Eaſt ſtake, and to ſtraine it to the South-Weſt ſtake, if the ſtake be at the juſt diſtance of the line, that ſide is rightly ſet out; then you may knock in a ſtake where the loop is, to repreſent the middle of that ſide, where the gate and the draw-bridge of the Fort is to be placed; and ſo prove all the other three ſides with your Line of 250 yards, knocking ſtakes in the middeſt on everie ſide; for they will ſtand you in ſtead, when you come to divide the ſides into ſix parts. Now if any of theſe ſides be amiſſe, and agree not with your Line, then you are to amend them by your Demi-circle and your Line, which is eaſily to be done; and when the foure angles and ſides are right, you are to faſten lines to the eight ſtakes as neare the ground as may be, and to ſet Pioniers to trace the Superficie of the Square with ſpades and pick-axes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſet out the Baſtions.</p>
               <p>That being done, you are to divide the foure ſides of the Square into ſix equall parts, and to knock in a ſtake at evene divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then you are to faſten a line of 90 yards to the former demi-Diagonall Line of 180 yards, that will then be of 270 yards, and to ſtraine the ſame<note n="*" place="margin">The diſtance from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to the point, is of 90 yards in this Square.</note> 90 yards beyond the foure Angle-ſtakes of the Square, after it is faſtened to the Center-ſtake, making the ſaid Line to touch the Angle-ſtake; and at the end of the ſaid line knock in a ſtake, and theſe foure ſtakes will repreſent the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101578:27"/>foure utmoſt points of the foure Baſtions, and the foure former Angle-ſtakes, will then repreſent the Center of the Baſtions. This being done, faſten a line one after another to the third ſtake of everie ſide, of<note n="*" place="margin">This Line of 230 yards is the juſt extent of the Line of defence of this Square.</note> 230 yards, and ſtraine the ſame to the foure ſtakes that repreſent the foure utmoſt points of the foure Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this line will ſet out the eight faces of the Baſtions, and all the Lines of defence; then you are to faſten a line one after another of 41 yards and two thirds to everie ſecond ſtake of the foure ſides,<note n="*" place="margin">The Line of the Flanks in this Square is of 41 yards and tvvo third parts.</note> and to ſtraine the ſame upon a ſtrait perpendicularie line till it come to cut the former line, that repreſents the line of defence, and ſets out the faces of the Baſtions; and where it cuts the other drive in a ſtake, and theſe eight ſtakes will repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſet out the eight Flanks and the foure Courtines: And that being done, you are to ſet Pioniers at work, to trace all theſe things before you go about to ſet out the Orillons.</p>
               <p>Now to avoyd miſtake, you were better to ſet out one ſide at a time, &amp; to have it traced as you ſet it out, for it wil ſave charges, becauſe it will not require ſo many lines. This being done, you are to ſet out the Orillons, and after the Orillons the dike; and when all is finiſhed, you are to erect the Breſt-work of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp with the earth taken from the ſmall dike, called <hi>La Cunette,</hi> adorning the ſame on the inſide with Turffe and a foot-ſtep, as I have formerly given large directions in Chap. 12. and Plate 9.</p>

               <p>THe Pentagon is alſo irregularie, yet leſſe then the Square; for the Angle of his Center is of 75 degrees, and the Angle flanked of the ſame extent, and his Angle flanking of 142 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and a halfe, his baſes or ſides are of 250 yards a peece, his circumference of 1250 yards, and his whole continent from out to out of 125000 ſquare yards, it is of a convenient forme
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101578:28"/>for a Citadell, or of a well-compact Towne, whoſe circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence doth not exceed three quarters of an Engliſh mile.</p>
               <p>Now to direct the Reader once for all,<note n="*" place="margin">Hovv you may knovv the continent of any Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon vvith va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles.</note> how he may ſpeedily calculate the continent of all ſorts of Angle Poligons, I have in this Figure ſet out a demonſtration of it, viz. you are firſt to draw a ſtrait perpendicularie from A to B, then a ſtrait parallel line from C to D, and then to joyne D and A by a ſtrait line, as it is demonſtrated in this Figure, and it will produce a demy long ſquare, his broad ſides containing, according to the ſcale of this Figure, 200 yards, and his end-ſide 125 yards, which being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed one by the other, it will produce 25000 yards, as the juſt continent of one of the Triangles of this Pentagon, which being multiplyed by five, (becauſe it containes five Triangles, the whole continent will amount to 125000 ſquare yards. Now the one third part of it being defalked for the bredth of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, the Market-place and the ſtreets, there will remaine for the Inhabitants houſes 83333 yards and a third part, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided by one hundred and fiftie ſquare yards, that wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for everie Inhabitants dwelling houſe, that is a peece of twelve yards and an halfe ſquare of all ſides, it will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this ſcantling containe 555 houſes, and as many Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, that are according to the rules of war, to billet in everie third houſe a Horſe-man, and in all the reſt two Foot-Souldiers apeece; ſo that it will containe 185 Horſe-men 740 Foot-men, and 555 Inhabitants, a ſufficient Garriſon to defend this place againſt an Army of ten thouſand men for three months; ſo it be provided with Ordnance, Armes, Ammunition, victuals, and all other neceſſaries for a Siege.</p>
               <p>Now to ſet out this Fort in the field, you are to bring along with you two men, one with lines, and the other with ſtakes: and when you have made choice of your Center the man is to knock in a ſtake, and you are to ſtand cloſe to this Center-ſtake, and having ſet the ſight of your Demy-circle upon the ray of 75. degrees that is the Angle of the Center of the Pentagon,<note n="*" place="margin">Note that this line of 240 yards is the extent of the demi dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonall line of the Pentagon.</note> the man that carrieth the lines is to faſten a line of 240. yards to the Center-ſtake, and to ſtraine the ſame full North upon a ſtrait perpendiculary line, and at the end of it he is to knock in a ſtake and this ſtake repreſents the North Angle of the Pentagon;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101578:28"/>that done, take your demy-circle and wind the right hand ray to the right hand, the man holding in his hand the line of 240. yards, ſtraining the ſame according to the ray of the demy-circle, and when he is at the end of the line and juſt againſt you agreeing with the ray of your demy-circle, let the man with the ſtakes knock in a ſtake at his feet, and this ſtake will repreſent the North Eaſt Angle of the Poligon, then turne your face to the North-Weſt, and with the ray of your demy-circle on the left hand, the man with the line following the ſame, and when he is juſt againſt you and the ray of the demy-circle, being at the end of the line, the man with the ſtakes is to knocke in another ſtake at his feet, and this ſtake will repreſent the North Weſt Angle of the Pentagon. And after this manner ſet out the South-Eaſt and South-Weſt Angles of the Pentagon, and having knockt in ſtakes, theſe five utmoſt ſtakes will repreſent the five Angles of the Pentagon, and by theſe obſervations, the gate and the draw-bridge of this Fort will be full South, and in the midſt of the South Courtine, to be defended by the flankes of two Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; when this is done, you are to take the line of 250. yards having a loop in the midſt, which line you are to ſtrain from ſtake to ſtake to prove whether your ſtakes are at an equall diſtance, driving at everie middle of all the ſides a ſtake, as you will be directed by the loop faſtened to the middle of the line: now if any of your ſtakes be amiſſe you may eaſily amend them, by the demy-circle, and the line, and when they are right, you are to faſten lines from ſtake to ſtake as neare the ground as may be; and ſet many Pioniers to trace the ſuperficie of this Pentagon, before you ſet out the Baſtions. And this is alſo the way how you ought to ſet out the equilaterall Triangle<note n="*" place="margin">Hovv to ſet out an equila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-circle ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in Chap. 12.</note> by the Demy-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſpoken of in the 12.

               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:101578:29"/>The Superficie of this Pentagon being traced you are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the five ſides of it into ſix equall parts, driving in everie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion a ſtake, then you are to faſten to the former line of 240. yards, another line of 83. yards, and a third, that is the juſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from the Center of the Baſtion to the utmoſt point of it, and when you have done ſo, you are to faſten the ſame to the Center ſtake, and to ſtraine it diagonall-wiſe 83. yards and one third part beyond the five Angle-ſtakes, making the line as you ſtraine it to touch the ſaid ſtake, and at the end of the line to drive in five ſtakes, that will repreſent the five utmoſt points of the five Baſtions. And for the ſetting out of the reſt, I referre you to avoid repetition to the two laſt Chapters, where you had large directions to ſet out the flanks and faces of the Baſtions, with their Orillons, Dikes, and Conterſcarpes; and will onely acquaint you with the demenſions of this Pentagon, ſince I did omit the ſame in the ſquare, yet I will give a hint of them in this place: the flankes of the ſquare were but forty yards, and the flankes of the Pentagon are forty one yards, and two third parts, their Courtines are alike of 166. yards and two third parts, the diſtance from the Center to the point of the Baſtion, in the ſquare was 86. yards, and in this Pentagon of 83. yards; the gorge of the Square and of the Pentagon alike, of 83. yards and one third part.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe Ovall is as irregularie as the Triangle, and one of the moſt difficult ſuperficies to ſet out in the field, becauſe of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary

It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a convenient ſuperficie, to fortifie a well-compacted market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towne, that may be reduced to this forme of three fourth parts of a mile Circumference.</p>
               <p>Now to ſet out the Superficie in the field,<note place="margin">Note once for all, that you are to have a Sea-compaſſe, vvhen you go about to ſet out any kind of Superficies in the field, to place your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle South, North, Eaſt, and VVeſt rightly.</note> you are to make choice of your Center, and to drive in a ſtake, and to faſten a line of 80 yards to that ſtake, and to ſtraine the ſame full Eaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtrait line, and to drive in a ſtake; then you are to wind the line about, and to ſtraine it full Weſt, and to drive in a ſtake, and theſe two laſt ſtakes divide the length of the Ovall into three equall parts, of 160. yards a piece, and repreſent the two Centers of the two circles, out of which the Ovall is formed, then you are to faſten a line to the Center ſtake of 220. yards, that is the extent of the demy-diagonall line of the South-Eaſt and North-Eaſt Angles, and of the South-Weſt and North-Weſt Angles, that are of 57. degrees and a halfe, upon theray of which Angle, you are to ſet the ſight of your demy-circle and ſtanding at the Center ſtake to turne your face full Eaſt, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ray of the circle on the right hand, the man with the fore-ſaid line ſtraining the ſame till he come juſt againſt you, and the ray of the circle, then is the man that carrieth the ſtakes, to drive a ſtake at his feet, then you are to winde the ray of your demy-circle on the left hand, and to do as you did at right hand, and at the end of the line to drive in a ſtake, and theſe two ſtakes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101578:30"/>will repreſent the South-Eaſt and the North-Eaſt Angles of the Ovall, then you are to turne your ſelfe full Weſt, and to ſet out with your demy-circle, and the fore-ſaid line the South-Weſt and North-Weſt Angles, driving two ſtakes at the end of the line. Then you are to faſten a line of 160. yards<note n="*" place="margin">This is the extent of the demi diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call line of the bredth of the Ovall.</note> to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtake, and to ſtraine the ſame full South, upon a ſtrait line, and at the end of the line the man with ſtakes is to drive in a ſtake, then wind the ſame line about, and ſtraine the ſame full North upon a ſtrait line, and at the end of the line drive in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtake, and theſe two laſt ſtakes repreſent the South and North Angles of the Ovall: then remove this line from the Center ſtake, and faſten it to the Eaſt Center circle ſtake, &amp; ſtrain it full Eaſt upon a ſtrait line, and at the end of the line drive in a ſtake, then remove the ſame line to the Weſt Circle Center ſtake, and ſtraine the ſame full Weſt upon a ſtrait line, and at the end of the line drive in a ſtake, and between theſe eight cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularie ſtakes conſiſts the ſuperficie of the Ovall.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the ſix ſides of it are circularie, you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the fore-ſaid line of 160 yards to the Center-ſtake, and to faſten your iron tracing-pin to one ſide of the line, and the other ſide to the ſtake, and to ſtraine the ſame full South, and to trace the ground as far as the line will give you leave, on both ſides of the South ſtake, and then you are to do the like on the North ſide; and that being done, you are to faſten theſe lines one after another to the Eaſt and Weſt circle Center-ſtakes, and to trace the Weſt and the Eaſt ſides of the Ovall with the point of your iron pin, as you did the South and North ſides, joyning the tracing of your pin on all ſides; and this being done, you are to ſet many Pioniers to make the tracing deeper with ſpades, or with the flat ends of their pick-axes.</p>
               <p>And when this Superficie of the Ovall is ſufficiently traced, you are to divide the ſix circularie ſides into ſix equall parts, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſtake in everie diviſion; then you are to faſten a line of 85 yards to everie Angle-ſtake one after another, and to ſtraine the ſame upon a ſtrait Diagonall line from the foure Angle-ſtakes that repreſent the South-weſt and North-weſt, and South-Eaſt and North-Eaſt Angles; but upon a ſtrait Diametricall line from the South and North Angle-ſtakes, and at everie end of the line
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:101578:30"/>you are to drive in a ſtake, and theſe ſix ſtakes will repreſent the ſix vtmoſt points of the ſix Baſtions; then you are to faſten a line of 240 yards to everie third ſtake of your ſix ſides, to ſet out by it the faces and the line of defence of the Baſtions, by ſtraining and faſtning this line to everie Angle ſtake twice to ſet out the twelve faces, then you are to faſten a line of 45 yards to everie ſecond ſtake of the ſix ſides or baſes, and to ſtraine this line not perpendicularie-wiſe, as you have done formerly, when you did ſet out the Baſtions with Orillons, but five yards more bevell, toward the next Baſtion, then ſtrait; and where the Line cuts the other that ſets out the faces of the Baſtions and the Line of defence, you are to drive a ſtake, and after this manner ſet out all the reſt, till you have gone round.</p>
               <p>Now let me informe you once for all, that the ſafeſt and the moſt frugall way to ſet out your Baſtions after your maine Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficie is ſet out, is to ſet out one halfe Baſtion at a time, and to have it<note n="*" place="margin">A generall obſervation to be noted.</note> preſently traced before you remove your Line; for theſe two Lines, one long to ſet out the faces and the Line of defence, and a ſhort one to ſet out the Flanks will ſerve turne; and beſides, it will prevent all confuſion and miſtakes.</p>

               <p>I have in this Superficie, as being the laſt of this Method of Fortification, ſet out the broad ſtreets, that go round about the Rampiers, and from the Rampiers to the Market-place, that are to be ten yards broad, and the Market-place of an hundred yards in her Diametricall Line, and of the ſame forme of the Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sexagon; for you are to obſerve in all new erected Forts,<note n="*" place="margin">The Market place of a nevv erected Fort, Citadell, or Garriſon, is to be of the ſame forme of the out-Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie of the vvorks.</note> Citadels, or Garriſons, to reduce the Market-place after the forme of the out-ſide works, to be the more compleat, <hi>viz.</hi> if it be an equilaterall Triangle, or a Square, or a Pentagon, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place is to be of the ſame forme of a Triangle, or a Square, or a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:101578:31"/>Pentagon. Moreover, you are carefully to obſerve to line out in everie one of them, broad ſtreets of thirtie foot broad round about the Rampiers, and from the Rampiers to the Market-place, and theſe broad ſtreets that run from the Rampiers to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, are alwayes in this Method of Fortification, to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtrait Diagonall, or Diametricall Line from the Center of the Baſtion, to the Center of the Market-place, as theſe are drawn in this Figure for theſe reaſons: 1 The ſtreets round about the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers ſerve for all manner of carriages to be brought to the works, and for the Horſe-men to ride to the releef of any of the rampiers in the time of a ſiege or ſtorm. 2 The great ſtreets that run from the<note n="*" place="margin">For vvhat uſe broad ſtreets lined round about the Rampters and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, are erected.</note> Market-place to the Boſtions, ſerve for a Troop of Horſe, of five of a breſt; or for a Company of Foot, with five or ſix men on a breſt, to come to the releefe of any of the Baſtions that are ſtormed. 3 The Market-place is always to ſerve as the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz for Souldiers to gather themſelves together, to be ſent by the Governour where occaſion requires. I have alſo ſet out the order that is to be obſerved in the erecting of the houſes for the Inhabitants, that are to be lined out with ſtrait double ranges, that gardens or back-ſides may joyne one againſt another, that houſes may have the more aire and light, and that all their doores may open to the ſtreets, that are to be fifteen foot broad; for narrow lanes are dangerous in Garriſon Towns. The Store-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Magazines of Powder, Bullet, Fire-works, Engins, Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Pioniers tooles; and proviſion of victuals, as Corn, Meale, Oat-meale, Oats, Malt, Hay, Salt, Powder Beefe, Bacon, Dry fiſh, Butter, Cheeſe, Rice, White Peaſe, and all ſuch neceſſaries, are to be in thoſe houſes ſeated round about the Market-place, as the moſt ſafeſt ſeat of the Towne.</p>
               <p>All theſe obſervations are carefully to be regarded, if in caſe the State ſhould erect any new Forts, Citadels, or Garriſon towns, where there never was any habitation before; for ſuch a new erected Hold would ten times be more ſerviceable then any old erected Towne in this Kingdome; (provided all the dimenſions of this Method be obſerved, that ſhall clearly be deſcribed in the Ichnography of this Chapter) becauſe they are for the greater part of deformed ſhapes, and of a vaſt extent, and not compacted together, nor their ſtreets well lined, nor ranged in order, nor
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:101578:32"/>their houſes well contrived, ſome of them being verie high, and ſome verie low; but theſe of this new<note n="*" place="margin">Of the height of the nevv-erected Houſes in a nevv Fort, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell, or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon tovvn.</note> erection are to be all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and not above two ſtories high, that may not exceed with with their roofe thirtie foot high at the moſt, that the ridge of the top of their houſes may be lower then the top of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier Breſt-work by nine foot.</p>
               <p>Now to ſet out this Sexagon in the field, you are to make choice of the Center, and to drive in a ſtake and to faſten to that ſtake a line of three hundred yards, and a foot over, which line the two men that are alwayes to be with you to carrie your inſtruments, lines, and ſtakes, are to ſtraine full Eaſt, after you have taken with a good<note n="*" place="margin">An Enginier is never to be vvithout a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mi-circle, and a good Sea-Compaſſe.</note> ſea-compaſſe the Eaſt and Weſt points.

Then your men are to untwiſt the line from the ſtakes and to wind it about to the Weſt point, and to ſtraine it and to drive in three ſtakes as they did before, and the laſt ſtake will repreſent the Weſt Angle of the Sexagon: Then you are to ſtake your demi-circle, and to ſet the ſight of it upon the ray of 60. degrees, and to ſtand at the Center-ſtake and to turne your face and demi-circle to the Eaſt ſtake, winding the ray of the demi-circle Eaſt and by South, then are your men to follow that ray with the line, driving at every hundred yards a ſtake, and when they are at the end of the line juſt againſt you, and the ray of your demi-circle of 60. degrees, let them drive in a third ſtake and it will repreſent the Eaſt and by South Angle of the Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; then turne your ſelfe and your demi-circle Eaſt and by North, and ſet out after this verie manner the Eaſt and by North Angle, and when that is done, turne your felfe full Weſt, and ſet out after this manner the Weſt and by North, and Weſt and

               <p>When the Superficie of the Sexagon is traced, you are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide your ſix ſides into ſix equall parts, that will be of fifty yards a piece, and to drive in everie diviſion a ſtake, then you are to faſten one end of your three hundred yards line to everie one of the ſix angles-ſtakes, one after another, and to ſtraine the ſame into the field one hundred yards beyond the<note n="*" place="margin">Becauſe the diſtance from the center of the baſtion to the utmoſt point, is in this Sexagon of 100 yards.</note> Angle-ſtakes, according to the former rowes of ſtakes you did drive in, whe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther the lines of them were diametricall or diagonall, and theſe ſix ſtakes will repreſent the ſix vtmoſt angles of the Baſtions; the ſix former Angles of the ſides of the Sexagon, being by theſe laſt ſix ſtakes become the Center of the Baſtions.

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of the third Method of Fortification, by Avant-guards and out-Guards, and halfe Moones in generall.</head>
               <p>THe third method of Fortification would be as chargable as the ſecond, if we ſhould imitate in the erecting of it, the demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and proportions of the Italian and French Enginiers, or adorn them as they do with free-ſtone of all ſides to the <hi>Cordeau,</hi> or water-table, that is alwaies five yards higher then the firme or even ground, and ſometimes from the bottome of the dike, that are ordinarily 30. yards broad, 10 yards deep, and their Rampiers 20. yards broad, beſides the Breſt-workes, and three foot ſteps that are alſo 10. yards broad in the bottome, and 20. foot thick at top, their Rampiers being ordinarily brought up fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen foot with ſtone-work from the even-ground and fifteen foot with turfe and earth, beſides the breſt-work of nine or ten foot high, that is in all ſome forty foot high, beſides the depth of the dike, and this they terme in the French Tongue, <hi>Tels Rampars ſont hors de danger deſeallade,</hi> that is, ſuch Rampiers are out of danger of ſcaling; and ſo they are, for ladders of fifty rounds, cannot be raiſed in the night time without noiſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:101578:34"/>they be made never ſo artificially, to be diſmounted or ſet up by ſcrewes in five or ſix peeces.</p>
               <p>But ſince we have neither time, nor meanes, nor men, to man, to erect, or to finiſh ſuch great works, wee will reduce this third Method of Fortification, that is capable above all others, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure without being much the worſe, alterations or diminutions in her dimenſions and proportions, to theſe enſuing ſcantlings.</p>
               <p>The dikes are to be ten yards broad and five yards deep, not ſlope to nothing, as our Countrey ignorant Surveyours make theirs, more like hedge-dikes, then of Works and Fortifications; but only allowing a foot ſlope in everie yard; and by this meanes the broad dike when it is finiſhed, will be twentie foot broad, out of which is to be taken a ſmall dike of ſixteen foot broad, and eight or ten foot deepe, called by the French <hi>La Cunnette;</hi> and the ſlope of this dike is not to be on everie ſide above a yard, that it may remaine ten foot broad in the bottome; and theſe dikes are far better, and more difficult to be filled, or to be paſſed over, then thoſe that are not a foot broad in in the bottome, as I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved in Chap. 16.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the great dike is no broader nor deeper than is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-ſaid, and that the earth that is to be digged out of the ſmall dike is to be throwne on the field ſide, ſome twelve foot beyond the brim of the great dike, for to erect when all the inward works are perfected, a Counterſcarp with a Breſt-work round about the Garriſon, of ſix foot high with a ſtep, wee will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lately cut off from this forraine Method the whole Rampier, and erect only with Turffe, and the earth that is taken out of the great dike, a Breſt-work of twelve foot high within ſide, and nine foot high without ſide from the firme ground, leaving a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-table between the Turffe and the brim of the dike, of eight inches, if the earth be good; but if it be ſandy, or of a running clay, it muſt be left eighteen inches, or two foot broad, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the chat of ſelfe-conceited and ignorant men. The ſlope of the Breſt-work without ſide is not to be above a yard in three yards, if the earth be good; but if it be naught, a foot more will ſerve, ſo it be well filled and rammed at everie foure courſes of Turffe with ſmall bruſh bavins, as I have formerly given'di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. And for the flope within ſide, it is ſufficient if it be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:101578:34"/>two foot in twelve, or one foot in ſix; for the three foot-ſteps are as a buttereſſe unto it. And the reaſon why the out-ſide of the Breſt-work is but nine foot, and the in-ſide twelve, is, that the Breſt-work is to be with five foot-ſteps, foure and thirtie foot in the bottome, and twentie foot at top, and ſo great a thickneſſe is to have at leaſt a yard ſlope to convey the raine-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter away, and to make way for the Musketiers to cleare with their ſhot the brim of the dike. But in this place I will confute the groſſe ignorance and fooliſh frugalitie of ſome Countrey Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyours, that ſet the inward wall of their Breſt-work upon looſe earth, in ſtead of bringing it up as well as the out-ſide from the firme ground, and all to ſave ſome few loads of Turffe, and a little labour; but this is a deſtructive frugalitie; for by it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a yeare or two, all their Breſt-works cleave in the middeſt, and fall as much inward as outward. Now if theſe dimenſions and proportions be obſerved in this third, and in the fourth Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; and the Faces, Flanks, and Angles of the Avant-guards, Out-guards, Halfe Moones, and ſmall Flanks truly lined and ſet out according to Art, our works ſhould not be an object of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion to Forrainers, as they are, and the charges would not have been greater then they have been, to erect our ſlight and ill-flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Redouts, Scar-crow mounts, and ridiculous winding An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles as we have done, for it were better not to fortifie at all; but if we fortifie thus, we need not feare with Gods favour, to loſe our Garriſons as we have done, in eight and fortie houres.</p>

               <p>THe opinion of Enginiers doth varie much, concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the ſides or baſes of any manner of regulary Superficie, that is to be fortified by Baſtious:<note n="*" place="margin">See his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions, Chap. 17. and pag. 49.</note> Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> would have it 900 foot, or 1000 foot at the moſt. The Italian Enginiers
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101578:35"/>from 700 foot to 800 foot, and yet their foot is ſmaller then ours; and <hi>Errard de Barleduck,</hi> an ancient French Enginier, would have it from 600 foot to 700 foot: But Sir <hi>Anthony de Ville,</hi> and <hi>Honorat de Meynier,</hi> two later rare French Enginiers, would have the extent of it of 750 foot, that is 250 yards, and with their opinion I concur and aſſent: And to that end I have drawne all the ſides or baſes of the two firſt Methods, the Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon excepted, of 250 yards a peece, as the moſt convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all the proportions of a Fortification by Baſtions, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dimenſion or ſcantling;<note place="margin">Of the true extent of the ſide, to have the Line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from 200 yards, to 240 yards.</note> but above all, the Line of defence to her true extent, and have only drawne the ſides of the Sexagon of three hundred yards a peece, to ſhew that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> was as much out in that extent, as <hi>Errard de Barleduck</hi> was, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it ſhould be from ſix to ſeven hundred foot at the moſt; for if his opinion be followed, the Courtines and the Line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will be ſomething too ſhort, as it may appeare in all his Modells, and ſpecially in his regularie Angle Poligons, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſeven Angles. On the other ſide, if Mr. <hi>Wards</hi> opinion be followed, the Courtine and the Line of defence will be ſome thing of the longeſt, as it may appeare by the Sexagon demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in Plate 12. And therefore I conclude, that 750 foot is the beſt extent for the ſide or the baſe of any Poligon fertified by Baſtions.</p>
               <p>But as concerning the ſides or baſes of theſe two laſt enſuing Methods, by Avant-guards and ſmall Flankers, the baſes or ſides of all manner of Superficies may be (if you pleaſe) from five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, to two thouſand yards, ſo you obſerve in your diviſion, or in the placing of your Avant-guards and ſmal Flankers, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie yards between Center and Center of everie one of them. But as for Forts that have no need to have neither A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-guards, nor ſmall Flankers, but only in their Angles, you are then to obſerve carefully to make their ſides of no longer extent then of 250 yards a peece.</p>
               <p>Now if any ſhould ſo much miſtake himſelfe, as to erect two or three Baſtions upon a ſide of 500 or 750 yards, theſe Baſtions are no more true Baſtions, but Ravelias; for it is improper for a Baſtion to be placed any where, but upon an Angle. Suppoſe then you would fortifie a Towne that containeth ſome three
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:101578:35"/>miles circumference, that can be reduced in a circularie forme: if you will fortifie the ſame by 24 Baſtions, you muſt reduce this circularie forme into foure and twentie ſides, and as many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles; but if you fortifie the ſame by Avant-guards, or ſmall Flankers, you need not to divide this circularie forme, but into eight ſides, and place in everie ſide two Avant-guards, and one halfe Moone beyond the dike, to defend the Angle; but if you fortifie the ſame by ſmall Flankers, then everie one of theſe eight Angles is to have a Flanker, and everie ſide two Flankers more, as it is demonſtrated in Plate 18, and 23.

               <p>Concerning the Line of defence,<note n="*" place="margin">See his Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions, Chap. 30. and pag. 74.</note> Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> is over-bitter againſt <hi>Errard de Barleduck,</hi> becauſe hee draweth his Line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from the verie corner of the Flank, and not from the third of the baſe or ſide which he calleth the Courtine. I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it is better to draw the Line of defence from the third part of the ſide or baſe, as Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> would have it, then from the corner of the Flank, and eſpecially if the ſides of the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be of<note n="*" place="margin">If a ſide is of 300 yards, it is better to dravv the Line of defence from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Courtine, then from the third part of it.</note> 300 yards a peece, as Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> would have them to be; nay, it were better if it were drawne from the middle of the ſide or Courtine, (for it is one and the ſame thing.) To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the errour of the extent of his ſides, of three hundred yards a peece, that makes the Line of defence unſerviceable for the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot, if the Line be drawne from the third part of the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; whereas it would ſerve turne, and amend the errour of the over-long extent of the fide, if it were drawne from the middle of the Courtine. Yet for all this ſmall errour of <hi>Errard,</hi> I ſee no reaſon why Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> ſhould be ſo bitter againſt him, for his owne Modells are not without defects; for it is a verie good horſe that never ſtumbleth. And it is well knowne to all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, that <hi>Errard de Barleduck</hi> was an experienced Enginier, and the firſt that adorned the Art of Fortification in the French tongue. Beſides, the Line of defence is better (in the Superficies of the equilaterall Triangle, and of the Square) to be taken from the corner of the Flank, then from the third part of the ſide or Courtine, becauſe it openeth the breſt of the Baſtion, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth their exteriour Angle more obtus, then when it is drawne
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:101578:36"/>from the third part of the Courtine. Moreover, Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> doth wrong or miſtake <hi>Errard,</hi> and the other French Enginier, to alledge as he doth, that they relye moſt upon the musket-ſhot for the defence of the Courtines, faces, and points of their Baſtions, deſpiſing the defence of them b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the Ordnance ſhot; the defence of the musket-ſhot being (ſaith hee) no defence at all, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the Aſſailant from caſting their galleries over the mote. But I ſay that Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> doth miſtake the meaning of <hi>Errard,</hi> and of the reſt of the French Enginiers; for they erect their lower Flanks, and provide them with Demi-Cannon; only to prevent the caſting of galleries over their mote: And for their upper Flanks, beſides the Demi-Culverins they place upon them, to defend the faces and points of their Baſtions, they place Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers to diſcharge their ſhot continually, while their Demi-Culverins are charging againe, and ſo make uſe of Ordnance and of Musket-ſhot alſo, for the defence of them. Therefore I will conclude with the Aſſertion of one of the greateſt<note n="*" place="margin">See the Duke of Roan in his Perfect Captaine, Chap. 8.</note> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of our dayes, that the extent of the Line of defence is the beſt, that is convenient for the Musket-ſhot, as well as for the Cannon-ſhot.</p>

               <p>THe Circumference of this Superfice is ſo great that it contains 3680. yards, that is two Engliſh mile, and one third part of a mile, and therefore fitter to fortifie ſome Corporation town then for a Fort, ſo it may be reduced to this forme; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the Center of it are of fifty five degrees, and the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Angle of the halfe-Moones are of ſixty five degrees, halfe of the faces of the halfe-Moones are of 250. yards, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther halfe of 210. yards a piece, whereby they require to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by ſmall drakes, or ſacres, beſides the musket-ſhot, but if upon every point of the halfe Moone a platforme were erected
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101578:36"/>as they are moſt commonly in all Redoubts, or Forts after this manner, viz. the Angle upon which you intend to erect a plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, is to be brought up twelve foot high from the ground, to be levell with the inward ſide of the Breſt-worke, and towards the towne ſlope nothing, and when it is ſo, you are upon the laſt courſe of turfe, to place a frize with ſharp picked quarters, of ſix foot long, four inches broad, and three inches thick,<note n="*" place="margin">Seven or eight inches diſtance one from another.</note> jetting one yard over the dike and running a yard into the breſt-worke, that is to be raiſed ſo farre as the platforme goeth on both ſides, fix foot higher then the other Breſt-work, in which Breſt-work the Port-holes are to be made two on every ſide, ſo that theſe Angle-Breſt-workes are to be 18. foot from the ground, having a frize as is above ſaid round about the Platforme to free it from ſcaling, to place two Sacres, &amp; two Drakes upon everie platform, this Fortification being ſo provided, will be of great defence, and very offenſive to the aſſaylants, becauſe the halfe Moones flanke one another ſo well, that none can approach the ſides or the points of them, without great danger of their lives; but if the diametricall line of this Superficie were reduced leſſe by one halfe or the ſcale of it, brought from 30. yards to 15. yards, it would have been of a great defence, without Drakes or Sacres, by the musket-ſhot onely. But I have purpoſely ſet out the ſame ſo large to ſhow how ſuch great ſides may be ſet out in the field, for they are farre more difficult to ſet out, uhen ſhorter demenſions.</p>
               <p>Now to ſet it out in the field, you are to make choice of the Center, and to drive in a ſtake; then you are to have a line rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of 330.<note n="*" place="margin">This Line of three hundred and thirtie yards is the juſt Demi-Diagonall and Diametricall extent of the Line that is to ſet our the eight invvard Angles of this Superficie.</note> yards, having at everie fiftie yards a loop faſtened to it of one colour, and another loop of another colour faſtened to it at everie hundred yards, then you are to ſtand at the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſtake, and to turne your ſelfe full South, after you have ſet out with your Sea-compaſſe as neare as you can to that diſtance, of the line, the South, North, Eaſt, and Weſt points, becauſe the foure ſides of your croſſe are of neceſſity to be lined ſo; then ſet the ſight of your demi-circle upon the ray of 55. degrees, and wind the ray of your circle firſt on the left hand, and let the man with the line faſten the one end of it to the Center-ſtake, and follow with the other end of the line, the ray of your demi-circle,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101578:37"/>and when he is one hundred yards diſtance from you, and juſt againſt you, and the ray of your demi-circle, let the other man that carrieth the ſtakes, drive in a ſtake at his feet, and twift the line once or twice about the ſtake, obſerving alwaies to make the line to come to be ſtrained againe on that very ſide,<note n="*" place="margin">In ſides that are above one hundred yards, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire above tvvo ſtakes, you are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, to vvind the Line upon the ſtakes all of a ſide, to prevent breaks</note> that he firſt twiſted the ſame, to avoid breakes, becauſe the thickneſſe of a ſtake of two inches thick will cauſe a great break in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of three hundred yards, that being done, let him follow ſtill the ray of your demi-circle, and when he is another hundred yards diſtant from the laſt ſtake, and two hundred yards from you, but juſt againſt you, and the ray of your demi-circle, let the man with ſtakes drive in a ſecond ſtake at his feet, and winde the line about the ſtake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he did before, then let him go forward and ſtraine ſtill the line till he be a hundred yards more from the ſecond ſtake, and when he is juſt againſt you, and the ray of your demi-circle, let the man with ſtakes drive the third ſtake at his feet, and having twiſted the line about that ſtake as he did before, let the man with the line go forward 30. yards, and when he is juſt againſt you and the ray of the demi-circle, let the man with ſtakes, drive in the fourth ſtake at his feet, and betweene theſe foure ſtakes there will be 330. yards, and the laſt ſtake will repreſent the South-Eaſt inward Angle of the Croſſe; then you are to wind the ray of your demi-circle on the right hand, and to ſet out after the verie ſame manner the South-Weſt inward An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and having driven in foure ſtakes as before, you are to ſet out the other ſix Angles after the verie ſame manner as you have done theſe two, and when the eight Angles are ſet out thus, and ſtakes driven in them all, then remove the line of three hundred thirtie yards, and faſten another line to the Center-ſtake, of 250.<note n="*" place="margin">The extent of the Demi-Diametricall and Diagonall Line, from the Center to the vtmoſt point of the Haſſe Moone, is 500 yards.</note> yards, and ſtraine it South-Eaſt diagonall wiſe, this line being the juſt moytie of the demi-diogonall and diametricall line, from the Center-ſtake to the utmoſt points of the eight halfe Moones, and at the end of it drive in a ſtake, and this ſtake repreſents the Center of the South-Eaſt halfe Moon; then remove the line from the Center-ſtake and faſten the ſame to the laſt ſtake, and ſtraine it againe diagnail-wife, and that ſtake will reprſent the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt point of the South-Eaſt halfe Moone, then ſet out after the verie ſame manner the other ſeven Centers, and utmoſt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:101578:37"/>points of the halfe Moones. Now becauſe-the ſides or faces of your halfe Moones are not equall, eight of them being 250. yards a piece, and the other eight but 210 yards a piece, you are to ſet out the eight longeſt firſt by faſtening a line of 250 yards one after another to the foure ſtakes, that repreſents the foure ends of the two diametricall lines of the prickt Square demonſtrated in this Plate, and to ſtraine this line eight times one after another to the utmoſt Angle ſtakes that repreſent the utmoſt points of the halfe Moones, and as you ſtraine it, faſten the ſame to the ſtakes as neare as you can to the ground, that the Pioneers may trace that ſide, or face of the halfe Moone, before you remove the line to another ſide, and one ſide being ſet out and traced, ſet out and trace all the other ſeven ſides after this verie manner.</p>
               <p>Then you are to remove this line of 250. yards, and to faſten another line of 210. yards to the foure diagonall inward Angles Center ſtake, that are juſt opoſite to the Angles of the prickt Square demonſtrated in this Plate, to ſet out the eight ſhorter ſides or faces of the halfe Moones after the very ſame manner as you did ſet out the longer ſides or faces, and theſe being alſo ſet out and traced, the ſuperficie of this Fortification will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, then you are to ſet out the dikes according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions deſcribed in Chapter 17. and when the inward Works are finiſhed, then you are to erect the Counterſcarp with the earth that is taken out of the ſmall dike, called <hi>La Cunnette.</hi>

               <p>THe broad ſide of this Paralograme is of 900 yards, and the end ſide of it of 450 yards, and all the circumference of it 2700 yards, that is, an Engliſh mile, and three fifth parts of a mile; for her continent I will not ſtand upon, becauſe it is not of a convenient forme to erect a new garriſon, but onely fit to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie ſome market towne, if need ſhould require; of which form there are many in this Kingdome, moſt of them being as long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:101578:38"/>as they are broad: Yet let the Reader obſerve, that incaſe he be required to fortifie a towne that may be reduced to this forme, that hath her broad ſide of 700 yards, and her end ſide of 350 yards, that he may boldly undertake to fortifie the ſame after this manner, ſo he divide his end into five parts, and his broad ſide into ten parts, and doth reduce the reſt of the demenſions of the faces, breſts, flanks, courtines, and line of defence after the proportions of his ſides; for then the dimenſions of ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiation will be more complete then this, and altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſible by the musket ſhot. But I have ſet out this ſo on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſhew what may be done, when men are tied by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a place, and inforced to omit to erect foure Avant-guards leſſe then they ſhould, to avoid charges. The Angle of the Center of her broad ſide is of 135 degrees, and of her end ſide of 45 degrees. This is the moſt frugall way that can be invented to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a long town of ſo large an extent as this is; for it is almoſt a mile and three quarters in the circumference, her end ſide indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into five parts, two of which are allowed for the breſt of the two end Avant-guards, that contain 90 yards apeece, and the courtine 270 yards: her broad ſide is divided into ten equall parts, two of which are allowed for the breſt of the Avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards, that are of 90 yards a peece, uniforme with the end of the Avant-guards, the foure Angle Courtines are longer then the middle Courtine by 120 yards, becauſe of the addition of the long Flank to everie one of them, that extend themſelves into the field 120 yards more then the vtmoſt angles of the Paralog rame, the end and the middle Courtines are defenſible by the Muſket-ſhot, becauſe they are between two Flanks, and alſo becauſe the Line of defence of the faces of the Avant-guards is taken from the middle of the Courtine, whereby the Line of defence cometh to be from two hundred and fortie to two hundred and fiftie yards; but the long Angle Flanks cannot ſufficiently be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Musket-ſhot alone, without foure Drakes and foure Sacres, one Sacre and one Drake mounted upon everie one of the long Flanks, and with them, this Fortification will be of great defence: The ſhort Flanks are of 60 yards a peece, and the faces of the Avant-guards of 120 yards a peece, uniforme with the long Flanks.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ALL the ſides of this Equilateral Triangle are equall, and contain 520 yards apiece, ſo that her circumference is of 1560 yards, that is an Engliſh mile wanting 64 foot; the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle other Center is of 60 degrees. I omit her continent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of her large extent, that is fitter to fortifie a well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted town, that may be reduced to this form, then for a new Fort. Her ſides are divided into eight equall parts; two of which, are allowed for the two breſts of the Avant Guards, that contain 65 yards apiece; and the other ſix pares are divided e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually for the three Courtines, that containe 130 yards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece. Her long flanks are 100 yards apiece, and her ſhort flanks of 50 yards apiece, and the faces of her Avant Guards, are uniform to her long flanks, whereby they are alſo of 100 yards apiece. And by theſe dimenſions, it is apparent that this Superficie is a compact and compleat Fortification becauſe all her Faces, Flanks, Courtines, and Angles, can be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:101578:39"/>by the Muſquet ſhot; her line of defence is taken from the middle of the Courtine, and by this meanes of 160 yards.</p>
               <p>Yet let me inform the reader, that if he had occaſion to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a town that might be reduced into this Triangle for me, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her ſides were from 520 yards apiece, to 750 yards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, that he may boldly fortifie the ſame after this manner, ſo he divide his three ſides into 8 equall parts; and doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion his Flanks, Faces, Breſts, Courtines, and line of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, after this extent: for notwithſtanding this addition of 230 yards to every ſide of the Triangle, all the dimenſions of his fortification, will be defenſible by the Musquet ſhot.</p>
               <p>Now to ſet out this Superficie in the field, you are to make choice of your Center, and to knock in a ſtake; and after to ſet the ſight of your Demi-circle upon 60 degrees, and to follow the ſame directions given you in plate 9 for the ſetting out of a Triangle fortified by baſtions. And becauſe theſe ſides are as long againe as they were, I referre you to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given you in chap. 19. for the ſtraining of a long line by knocking in at every hundred yards of it a ſtake. But if it be an erected town that you are to fortifie, after this manner, goe up to the end of the town where you intend the North Angle of the Triangle ſhall be, and turn your face South; and with your Demi-circle, when the ſight of it is ſet upon the ray of 60 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſet out the South-Eaſt Angle of the Triangle, cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:101578:39"/>then is the Superficie of the Triangle perfected, that you are preſently to have traced, by many Pioniers; but if there be any errour, you are to amend the ſame by your Demi-circle and your lines.</p>
               <p>The Superficie of the Triangle being traced, you are to divide the ſides into 8 parts, and at every diviſion to knock 8 ſtakes; knocking in alſo a ſtake in the middle of every ſide, for it will ſerve to ſet out the faces of the Avant guards, and the lines of defence, allowing two parts to every Courtine, and two parts to the two breſts of the Avant guards; and at every third ſtake of every ſide, you are to faſten a line of 32 yards and ½, and to ſtrain it firſt on the right hand along the ſide traced; and at the ſide of the line you are to knock in a ſtake, and then you are to wind the ſame line on the left hand, and to ſtraine it along the ſide traced; and at the end of the line you are to knock in a ſtake, and theſe two ſtakes will repreſent the breadth of the breſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Guards; the exteriour ſtake toward the Angles of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, repreſenting the beginning of the long flank, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtake toward the middle of the ſide, repreſenting the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſhort flank, and as you have ſet out this firſt breſt of the Avant Guard, you are to ſet out the other five after the ſame manner.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Fortifications of the ſquare, fortified by Avant Guards, and Out-Guards, demonſtrated in Plate <hi>16.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe foure ſides of this ſquare containes 400 yards apiece, and by conſequence the circumference of it is of 1600 yards, that is almoſt an Engliſh mile; the Angle of his Center is of 90 degrees; I will omit his continent, for it is fitter to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a compact Market town, that may be reduced to this form, then for a Fort; it is to be ſet out after the manner as hath been deſcribed in Plate 10. And therefore I will only here inſert ſome directions how you are to ſet out the Avant Guards, and Out-Guards, by which it is fortified.</p>
               <p>The ſquare being ſet out and traced, you are to knock four ſtakes in the midſt of the foure ſides of it, then you are to faſten a line one after another to theſe foure ſtakes of 125 yards, and to ſtrain the ſame upon a ſtrait perpendicular line from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtake, 125 yards into the field, and at every end of the line to knock in a ſtake, and theſe foure ſtakes will repreſent the middle of the faces of the foure Avant Guards; then you are to faſten a line of 41 yards ⅔. to the very ſame ſtakes whereon the line of 100 yards was faſtned to; that is, to be removed and put by: and this line of 41 yards, and ⅔. is to be ſtrained firſt on the right hand, and then on the left hand; upon the traced ſides of the ſquares, and at every end of the line you are to knock a ſtake; and having done ſo to all the four ſides one after another, theſe eight ſtakes will repreſent the breadth of the breſt of the foure Avant-Guards: that is of 83 yards, ⅓. for the Avant Guards are to be one third part longer then they are broad; then you are to faſten to every one of theſe laſt ſtakes, the former line of one hundred yards one after another, and to ſtraine the ſame paralel wiſe to the ſtakes that repreſent the middle of the face of the Avant Guards; and at the end of every line you are to knock a ſtake, and to trace that flanke of the Avant Guards, before you
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101578:41"/>remove the line to the other flanks ſtake; and having done ſo round, and knockt in eight ſtakes, all the flanks will be ſet out and traced: then you are to remove the line of 100 yards, and lay it by, and to faſten the former line of 41 yards, 1/5. to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt middle ſtakes, that repreſent the middle of the faces of the Avant Guards, and to ſtraine and faſten the ſame firſt to the right hand ſtake, and then to the left hand ſtake that repreſents the utmoſt Angles of the Avant Guards; but before you wind the line from the right hand, to the left hand ſtake, have that moity of the face of the Avant Guard traced, then wind the line on the left hand, and trace the other moity of the face; and as you have ſet out and traced that face of the Avant Guard, doe all the reſt after this manner: which being done, your foure Avant Guards will be perfectly fet out and traced.</p>
               <p>Then you are to ſet out all your ditches after the ſame dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions deſcribed in chap. 17. and to caſt all the earth inward; to erect your breſt-works and their foot-ſteps, of that height and breadth mentioned in the ſaid Chapter. And when all the ditches, breſt-works, and foot-ſteps are finiſhed, then you are to ſet out the ſmall ditch called <hi>La cunette,</hi> out of the great ditch; end with the earth that is taken from it, you are to erect the breſt-work with the foot-ſtep of it of your <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> foure yards beyond the brim of the great ditch. Before you ſet out any of your Out-guards, that are not to be undertaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breſt-work and the ſlope of it belonging to the <hi>Contre eſearpe,</hi> be fully finiſhed; only you are to leave a gate of 12 ſoot broad againſt the places where you are to erect your out-gtards, and theſe gates are to be made up by ſo many ſtrong and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Turn-Pikes, well ironed, with iron pikes, and good haſps and locks: for by theſe you are to releive your Out-guards, or make your retreat, if you be driven from the Out-guards: all this being finiſhed, you are to ſet out the Out-guards after this manner.</p>
               <p>The foure Out-guards againſt the foure Angles of the ſquare, are foure equilater all Triangies or Holfe-moones of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yards on all ſides, two of the ſides are to have a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:101578:41"/>the other ſide towards the Angle of the ſquare is to be open, that the aſſailants may be diſcovered if they ſhould poſſeſſe themſelves of theſe Out-guards; he Points of theſe Triangles that are towards the Angles of the ſquare, are to be 16 foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the brim of the ditch.</p>
               <p>The foure ſmaller Triangles have their Baſe 13 yards longer then their two ſides that are to have ditches and breſtworks that are to be of the very ſame dimenſions of their former Triangles; their baſe is of 83. and their fortified ſides of 70 yards; the firſt defend the Angles of the ſquare and the flanks of the Avant Guards, and the laſt defends the faces of the Avant Guards; ſo that this fortification is compleat, ſtrong, and of great defence: the coming in is to be in the middle of the South Avant Guards, for the gate and the draw-bridge are flanked, and covered by one of the Halfe-moons.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of the Fortifications of the Pentagon fortified by Avant Guards, and Out-Guards, demonſtrated in Plate <hi>17.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have formerly ſhown in Plate 11, how to ſet out the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in the field; to omit repetitions, I will onely give you ſome directions how to ſet out the Avant Guards, and the Out-guards of this Pentagon, becauſe this Fortification differs from the other. The Angle of the Pentagon is of 75 degrees, his five ſides are of 240 yards apiece, ten yards leſſe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the circumference of it is 1200 yards, that is almoſt three quarters of an Engliſh mile, a very convenient form for a Royall Fort for the continent of it: it differs little from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe the circumference of it is but 50 yards leſſe, and therefore I will referre you to Plate 11. only I will inform you that if the circumference of it were a quarter of a mile greater then it is, that it might be defended, being fortified after this method by a ſmaller number of men then the other could be, that is fortified by baſtions, with orillons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:101578:42"/>When the Superficie of the Pentagon is fully ſet out and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, you are to divide his five ſides, into three<note n="*" place="margin">Note by this that the breſt of the Avant Guard is 80 yards broad.</note> equall parts, that will be of 80 yards apiece, and you are to knock in ſtakes in all their diviſions; then you are to divide the middle diviſion in two parts, that there may be a ſtake knockt in to repreſent the middle of every ſide. Then you are to faſten a line of 80 yards<note n="*" place="margin">Note that the greateſt ſlanks of the Av nt Guards advance 80 yards into the field.</note> to the South-Eaſt Angle ſtake, and to ſtrain the ſame full Eaſt upon a ſtrait line agreeing with the ſide, and at the end of the line knock in a ſtake; then remove that line and faſten the ſame to the North and by Eaſt Angle ſtake, and to ſtrain it as before, and to knock in a ſtake; then remove that line, and faſten the ſame to the North and by Weſt Angle ſtake, and ſtrain it as before, and knock in a ſtake; then remove the line and doe the like, to the Weſt and by North Angle, and as much to the Weſt and by South ſtake, ſtraining the line as is ſaid before; and at every fide of the line knock in a ſtake, and theſe five ſtakes will repreſent the five out-moſt Angles or Points of the five Avant Guards. Then remove that line, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten a ſhorter line of<note n="*" place="margin">The ſhort ſlank is ſorcy yards.</note> 40 yards to the ſecond ſtake of the South ſide, on the left hand South Weſt; and ſtrain the ſame into the field perpendiculary wiſe, and knock in a ſtake at the end of the line, and this line will repreſent the ſhort flank of the South-Weſt Avant Guard: and as you have ſet out this ſhort frank, ſet out the other foure, and knock ſtakes at every end of the line, and theſe five ſtakes will repreſent the five ſhort flanks. Then faſten the former line of 80 yards to every one of theſe laſt ſtakes, one after another; and firſt of all to the South-Weſt ſhort flank, and ſtrain the ſame Diagonal wiſe, faſtening the ſame to the ſtakes that repreſent the out-moſt Point of the Avant Guard: and before the line be removed, ſet Pioniers to trace the ſame, and it will ſet out the face<note n="*" place="margin">The line of defence is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the midale of the ſide or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine that is in this figure of 240 yards.</note> of the South-Weſt Avant Guard; and as you have ſet out this face, ſet out the other foure, after the ſame manner. You are to obſerve, that if a line of foure hundred yards could be ſtrained from the South-Eaſt Angle of the ſide of the Pentagon, and faſtned to the outmoſt Point ſtake of the South-Weſt Avant Guard, that this Diagona line that repreſents and ſets out the face, would be more perfect, for it would cut the end of the ſhort flank, and terminate it ſelfe at
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:101578:42"/>the end or point of the long flank; but this cannot be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently: only when you ſet out theſe faces, ſtand with your Demi-circle at every Angle ſtake of the ſide oppoſite to the face you ſet out, and by the Diagonal ray of your circle, you may guide the line of the faces, to be ſet out as perfectly, as if a line of 400 yards had been ſtrained.</p>
               <p>Now when you have thus ſet out and traced the five Avant Guards, with their faces, long and ſhort flanks; you are to ſet out all your ditches, after the dimenſions deſcribed in chap. 17. Caſting the earth of them inward, to erect the breſt-works and their five foot-ſteps of that height, breadth, and thickneſſe, there deſcribed. And when all your inward works, and the great ditch is finiſhed, you are to ſet out the <hi>Cunette</hi> or ſmall ditch out of the great ditch, and to erect with the earth that is taken out of it, the <hi>Contre eſcarpe</hi> breſt-work, diſtant from the orim of the great ditch foure yards, obſerving the rules and dimenſions deſcribed in chap. 17. and alſo five places of twelve foot apiece to be left open in the breſt-work of the <hi>Contre eſcarpe;</hi> to ſet five Turn-Pikes right againſt theſe five Halfe-moones here demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, which Halfe-moones you are to ſet out after your <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre eſcarpe</hi> breſt-work is finiſhed, placing the open ſide of them within 16 foot diſtance of the ſlope of your <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> that there may be a cleare paſſage for horſe and foot to come to the Halfe-moones, without ſpoyling of the ſlope of the <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> that the French call <hi>glaſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The five Out-guards of this figure are five Halfe-moones, that have one ſide longer than the other by twenty yards;<note n="*" place="margin">And this muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Ling ſide of the Halt-moones, may cover the ſlanks of the Avant Guards.</note> the long ſide is of 80 yards, and the ſhort ſide of 60 yards; their ditch is to be nine foot broad, and fix foot deep; their breſt-work is to be 9 foot broad in the botteme, with the foot-ſtep; and ſix foot thick at top, having a foot ſlope; and their height ſix foot from the ground, and foure foot and a halfe from the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep. The gate and draw-bridge of this Fort is to be in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the South ſide, that it may be defended with the South-Weſt flank, and covered with the South Halfe-moon, marked with the letter <hi>A.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIV.</hi> Of the Fortification of the Demi-Sexagon fortified by Avant Guards, and Out-guards, demonſtrated in Plate <hi>18.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Sexagon is of a large extent, for her ſides are of 800 yards apiece, and by conſequence her cucumference is of 4800 yards, that is almoſt two Engliſh miles and a halfe; and therefore fitter to fortifie a good Corporation, then for a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, or Fort: the Angle of her Center is of 60 degrees. And the ſame directions that were given you for to ſet out the Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon demonſtrated in Plate 12. fortified by baſtions with oril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons will ſuffice, with the obſervations contained in chap. 19. <hi>viz.</hi> to knock in ſtakes at every hundred yards, when ſides, or Diametricall, or Diagonall lines exceed 250 yards.</p>
               <p>The Superficie of this Sexagon being then ſet out, and fully traced, as it hath been ſhowne in the foreſaid Plate; you are to divide every one of the Baſes into three equall parts, that will be of 266 yards, and ⅔. apiece; and to knock in a ſtake at every diviſion: then you are to faſten a line to the two inward ſtakes one after another of 60<note n="*" place="margin">60 Yards is the juſt moity of the breſt of the Avant Guards.</note> yards, and to ſtrain the ſame firſt on the right hand; and upon the ſide traced and the end of the line you are to knock in a ſtake, then you are to winde the ſaid line about on the left hand, and to ſtrain the ſame upon a ſtrait line upon the ſidetraced: and at the end of the line you are to knock in a ſtake, then you are to remove the line, and to faſten the ſame to the other in ward ſtake of that ſide, and to doe as you did before; and to knock in two ſtakes at the end of the line, and theſe foure ſtakes repreſent the breadth<note n="*" place="margin">That is of 120 Yards broad.</note> of the two breſts of theſe two Avant Guards, and the middle ſtake repreſents the Center of the Avant Guards. Then you are to ſet out the breſt of the other ten Avant Guards of the other five ſides, after the very ſame manner as you did theſe laſt.</p>
               <p>And that being done, you are to faſten a line of 120 yards to every one of the exteriour ſtakes that repreſent the breadth of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:101578:43"/>the breſts of the Avant Gnards, and to ſtrain the ſame into the field upon a ſtrait Diagonall line, derived from the Center ſtake of the Sexagon; that you are to guide by the ſight of your Demi-circle, ſtanding at the Center ſtake, while the man that carrieth your lines, ſtraineth the foreſaid line into the field: and at the end of it, the man that carrieth your ſtakes, is to knock in a ſtake, and this ſtake repreſents the utmoſt Point of the long flank of your firſt Avant Guard. And as you have ſet out this long<note n="*" place="margin">Note and obſerve, This courſe is to be taken, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi Diagonal line of this Sexagon, from the Center ſtake to the utmoſt Point of the long flank, is of 680 yards; that is too long a line to be convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrained.</note> flank, ſet out the other eleven that remaine. And that being done, you are to faſten a line of 60 yards to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtake of that Avant Guard, that repreſents the breadth of the breſt of it; and to ſtrain the ſame into the field parallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to that of the long flank; and at the end of it, you are to knock in a ſtake, and this ſtake repreſents the utmoſt point of the ſhort flank of that Avant Guard. But obſerve<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe long flanks, are of 120 yards apiece.</note> to trace the long and ſhort flanks before you remove the line to another flake, to avoid miſtake. And as you have ſet out this ſhort<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe ſhort flanks, are of 60 yards apiece</note> flank, ſet out the eleven that remain.</p>
               <p>That being done, knock fix ſtakes in the middle of the ſix ſides of this S xigon, then you are to faſten a line to every one of them one ofter another of 240 yards, and to ſtrain and faſten the ſame firſt on the right hand ſtake that repreſents the utmoſt Point of the long flanks, and this line will cut the end of the line of the ſhort flank, and ſet out the face of that Avant Guard, and withall doth repreſent the line of defence;<note n="*" place="margin">The line of defence is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the midſt of the Courtine, and the extent of it in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, is o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then you are to wind the very ſame line about, and to faſten it to the left hand inward ſtake that repreſents the utmoſt Point of that long flank, and to doe as you did before to the other on the right hand, and then the two Avant Guards of that fide of the Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon will be perfected; and as you have done this ſide; doe the other five ſides after the very ſame manner.</p>
               <p>When the twelve Aven Guards are thus ſet out and traced, you are to ſet out all the ditches of it, after the very ſame dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſet downe in chap. 17. Caſting all the earth inward, to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:101578:44"/>crect the breſt-works, and their five foot-ſteps; of that height, breadth, and thickneſſe; deſcribed in the aforeſaid chapter. And when they are all finiſhed, you are then to ſet out the ſmall ditch called <hi>La cunette,</hi> out of the great ditch, and with the earth that is taken out of it, you are to erect the breſt-werk of of your <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> with the foot-ſtep of it; the height of which is to be ſix foot high with the foot-ſtep from the ground, and foure foot and a halfe from the footſtep; and the top of it ſloped to nothing, and levelled with the firm ground, leaving ſix places of twelve foot broad to place ſix Turn-Pikes, right againſt the middle of the ſix Halfe-moons, that are to be erected after the breſt-works of the <hi>Contre eſcarpe</hi> are finiſhed; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the breſt-work and the brim of the great ditch, is to betwelve foot at the leaſt; and theſe Turn-Pikes are all of them to be locked in the night, and ſerve to retreat or releive the Out-guards in time of a ſiege.</p>
               <p>And when all this is perfected, you are to ſet out the ſix Out-guards, that are ſix Halfe-moones in the form of ſix equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterall Triangles, that have all their ſides equall, of one handred and forty yards apiece; their Baſe that lieth towards the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre eſcarpe</hi> is to be open, and the ends of it 20 foot or 24 foot from the ſlope of the <hi>Contre eſcarpe;</hi> and the coming to the town and the going out, is to be by the South and North Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon, marked by the letter <hi>A.</hi> For by this means the gate and draw-bridge will be ſecured and covered by the Half-moones; and the Horſe, Carts, or Foot that come to town, ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to wind about the ſaid Half-moon; and by it expoſed if they be enemies, to the musket ſhot of them that keep the breſt-works of the Half-moones. Now to ſecure theſe Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moones from ſurptiſes, beſides the Sentinel Perdues, there is to be a ſmall Court of Cuard in the midſt of them, and ſtrong Palliſadoes, with Palliſado gates; that extendeth from the Points or Angles, to the very breſt-works of the <hi>Contre eſcarpe.</hi> The ditches of theſe Halfe-moones are to be nine foot broad, and fix foot deep; their breſt-work 9 foot broad in the bottome, with their foot-ſtep; and their height fix foot from the ground, and foure foot and a halfe from the foot-ſtep; and their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at top ſix foot, having a foot ſlope towards the ditch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:101578:44"/>This Garriſon thus fortified, and manned with a thouſand foot and three hundred horſe, and provided with 24 peeces of Ordnance, Armes, Ammunition, Fire-works, and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and all other neceſſaries for a ſiege; will be able to oppoſe an Army of twelve thouſand men for 3 months. For to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, this method of Fortification, is as convenient for us in theſe times of civill diſtraction as any, for it is not of great charges, and requires leſſe men to man the ſame; and yet is ſafer and ſtronger three-fold, then our skare-crow Mounts: ſmall and ill flanked redouts, and winding Angles.</p>

It was invented to ſave charges, both in the erection of the works, and in the manning of the Garriſons; for I know no manner of Fortifications that will require leſſe men to defend it, nor ſmaller charges to erect it, then this method: and therefore the more convenient for us to make uſe of it in theſe times of civill diſtractions, in which we want meanes and time to erect ſtrong, compleat, and permanent Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and men to man and defend them; yet I will informe the reader of this truth, that if this method of Fortification be ſet and lined out by a judicious Enginier, and the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it here deſcribed, carefully obſerved; that it will be three-fold as ſtrong againe, and as permanent and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary then the Mounts, weak redoubts, and ſlight winding
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:101578:45"/>Angles, uſed In theſe dayes. And that a valiant and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Governour in a Garriſon thus fortified, will be able to defend it with twelve hundred foot, and three hundred horſe, although it be of three mile and a halfe circumference; then he could doe one that I know, fortified with Mounts and winding Angles; with eighteen hundred foot, and three hundred horſe.</p>
               <p>So much availeth the Art and the Method of Fortification in the defence of a corporation, and yet I dare affirm for a truth, that their charges have been greater, then if they they had erected ſuch works as theſe; with the very ſame dimenſions following.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1, The extent of the ſides or Baſes of this Method, are not to exceed two hundred and fifty yards.</item>
                  <item>2. The neck of their flankers is neither leſſe, nor exceeds in extent fifty yards.</item>
                  <item>3. The breſt of their flankers neither more nor leſſe then 60 yards.</item>
                  <item>4. The flanks of their flankers neither leſſe nor more then 25 yards.</item>
                  <item>5. Nor the faces of their flankers leſſe or more then fifty yards.</item>
                  <item>6. The Courtines between two flankers, is not to exceed two hundred yards.</item>
                  <item>7. Their line of defence is to be taken in this method from the middle of the Courtine, that it may not exceed one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty yards. Nor the exteriour Angle of their flanker, be more acute then theſe are.</item>
                  <item>8. The line of their flanks is not to be drawn upon a ſtrait perpendiculary line, as moſt men uſe to doe; for this way is deſtructive to the flanks, and they being reduced to duſt, the Garriſon is loſt. But they are drawne one ⅛. part more ſlope toward the other flank oppoſite to it, that the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the flankers may be thicker; and jet or extend ſo much the more over the ditches, to preſerve the flanks.</item>
                  <item>9. All the ditches are to be in this methed that hath no <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> or Out-guards, thirty foot broad, and twenty foot deep; the ſlope of them is to be for every yard a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:101578:45"/>foot on every ſide, that the very bottome of them may be ſixteen foot, and ⅔, broad; for it is a diſparagement to make the ditches of Fortifications, and Martiall works, like the ditches of incloſed grounds; beſides, they are not ſo ſafe, becauſe they are ſooner filled in a ſtorme: and this manner of ditches ſavours over much, of the ignorance and ſelfe-concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe of our country ſurveyers.</item>
                  <item>10. The breſt-works are to be twelve foot high within ſide, and nine foot without ſide; their in-ſide is to be carried up from the firm ground, as well as the out-ſide; and the five foot-ſteps within ſide are to be carried up after the breſt-work is finiſhed on both ſides; they are to be two foot<note n="*" place="margin">Of the breadth and height of the five foot-ſteps, and of the breſt-works.</note> broad, and eighteen inches high. The ſlope<note n="*" place="margin">the ſlope of breſt-work walls.</note> of the in-ſide wall is to be but a foot in ſix foot, becauſe the foot-ſteps ſerve inſtead of buttreſſes to that inward ſide; but the ſtep of the out-ſide wall is to be a foot in three; and a water table is to be left, of eight inches broad (if the earth be good) between the brim of the ditch; and the turfe of the out-ſide wall, if the ground be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or a tunning clay, it is to bee eighteen inches broad; notwithſtanding the chat of ignorant men. The bottome or foundation of the breſt-work is to be thirty five foot in the bottome, with the five foot-ſteps; and twenty foot broad at top, that it may be of Cannon proofe; and it is to have a ſlope towards the ditch of three foot: and for that purpoſe,<note place="margin">Of the water table of the breſt-works. Of the ſlope of the top of the breſt works, and of their thickneſſe.</note> the out-ſide wall is but nine foot, and the inward twelve foot; that the ſlope may be from twelve to nine. And obſerve once for all, that all the Angles of this method where you erect Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes, are to have another breſt-work fix foot higher then the reſt, in which you make your Port-holes; and that this breſt-work is to have a<note n="*" place="margin">Of the frize of the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</note> friſe when it is twelve foot from the ground, made of wooden pikes ſharpe at one and of ſix foot long, and foure inches broad, and three inches thick, that are to be placed eight inches diſtant one from another; jetting three foot over the ditch, and running a yard into the braſt-works.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe high breſt-works are at every foure courſe of turfe to be laid with bruſh, or bavin wood well rammed with the carth; if the crectors intend they ſhould be of continuance.</p>

                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:101578:46"/>Having ſo clearly expreſſed the dimenſions of this method of Fortification, I ſhall not need hereafter to ſpeak any thing at all of them, becauſe I have obſerved in theſe five Superficies following, theſe proportions related in their Sides, Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, Flanks, Breſts, Faces, Gorges, and Lines of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and ſo I come to the method it ſelfe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe eight ſides of this Octogon, containes two hundred and fifty yards apiece; and by conſequence, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of it is of two thouſand yards, that is an Engliſh mile; and the ⅕. part of a mile. The Angle of her Center is of 45 degrees, it is to be ſet out in the field as the Sexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, by the Demi-cirle and Lines; as it is deſcribed in Plate twelve, and Chapter 15. I will therefore only give you ſome directions how to ſet out the ſmall flankers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a new method of Fortification, that wee have not as yet given you any directions for.</p>
               <p>When the Superficie of this Octogon hath been ſet out and fully traced, after the manner you were directed to ſet out the Sexagon; you are to divide all the ſides of it in two equall parts, and to knock in a ſtake<note n="*" place="margin">From theſe middle ſtakes is the line of defence drawn, that is in this figure of 150. yards; and the Courtine 200 yards.</note> in every one of their diviſions; then you are to faſten a line of twenty five yards to every one of the eight Angle ſtakes one after another, and to ſtrain that line firſt on the right hand, and then at the left hand, upon a ſtrait line; upon the ſides traced on the left and right hand of that ſtake, and at the end of the line you are to knock a ſtake, and theſe two ſtakes will repreſent the two Demi-Gorges<note n="*" place="margin">The whole Gorge of the flankers is to be 50 yards.</note> of that flanker; then remove your line to another Angle ſtake, and doe as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101578:46"/>you did before, till you have ſet out all the demi-gorges after that manner. Then ſet by that line, and faſten another line of fiftie<note n="*" place="margin">The Line of fiftie yards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the center to the point of the flanker.</note> yards to every angle-ſtake of the ſides, and ſtraine the ſame into the field upon a ſtrait diagonall line, ſtanding at the center-ſtake with your demi-circle to guide the ſame, (becauſe the demi-dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonall line from the center-ſtake to the utmoſt point of the flank is of 380 yards in this Figure, and therefore too long to be ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned conveniently) and at the end of this line of fiftie yards drive in a ſtake, and this ſtake will repreſent the utmoſt angle or point of the ſaid flanker; and as you have done this, ſet out the other ſeven angles of the flankers after this verie manner; then you are to faſten a Line of 28<note n="*" place="margin">28 yards is the extent of the ſlope flank.</note> yards to everie one of the ſixteene ſtakes one after another, that repreſent the Demi-Gorges of the Flankers, and to ſtraine it three yards more ſlope then upon a ſtrait perpendicularie Line, towards the other Flanker of that ſide of the Octogon, and at the end of th Line you are to drive in a ſtake. The reaſon why you ſtraine this Line three yards more ſlope then ſtrait, is to preſerve the Flankes from the Enemies batterie, that are otherwiſe too much expoſed to be ruinated by it: when the Line of the Flank is drawne upon a ſtrait perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularie Line, you are alſo to obſerve that the ſtrait perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie Line of the Flank is but five and twentie yards, and that theſe three yards are added to it, that the Flanks may be three yards more ſlope then ſtrait, becauſe a ſlope line in five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yards extent, comes to be three yards longer then a ſtrait. And as you have ſet out this Flank, ſet out the other ſixteen after this manner, and drive in ſtakes in them all; that being done, you are to faſten a Line of 150 yards to the middle ſtake of every ſide, and ſtraine it firſt on the right hand, and then on the left, and as you ſtraine it, make it touch the Flank-ſtake, and faſten it to the ſtakes that repreſent the vtmoſt point of your Flankers, and this Line doth repreſent the Line of defence, and the<note n="*" place="margin">The face of the flanker is to be 25 yards, beſides the three yards added to thicken the Angle of the shoulder.</note> face of that Flanker; and before you remove the Line, have the face traced by the Pioniers, and this face extends it ſelfe from the Flank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to the ſtake that repreſents the vtmoſt angle of the Flanker. And as you have ſet out this face-ſtake, ſet out all the fifteene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they being ſet out and traced, your eight Flankers will be perfected. Then you are to ſet out all your dikes after
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:101578:47"/>the dimenſions deſcribed in Chap. 25. And theſe directions for the ſetting out of the Flankers of all the other enſuing Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſhall ſuffice once for all, to avoyd repetitions. This Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon thus ſet out, and the proportions of her Flankers thus obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, it will produce a ſtrong, and a verie regularie Fortification, fit to fortifie a faire Market-Towne, of a mile and a quarter cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, that may be reduced to this forme.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THis Paralograme fortified by 18. Flankers hath his broad ſides of 1500. yards, and his end ſides of 750. yards, for a long Paralograme is to be as long againe as broad, and a Demi-Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lograme one third part longer then it is broad; his Circumference is of 4500, yards, that is of two Engliſh miles, and one third part of a mile, a large Circumference for ſo ſmall a Continent, for it containes from out to out but 1125000. ſquare yards, whereas if there had been 750. yards added to his bredth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a Square, it had contained 2250000. ſquare yards, that is juſt as much againe; ſo much availeth in the Art of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to make choice of compact Townes for a Garriſon, when a place of three miles, and two fifth parts of a mile Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference can be fortified for one quarter part more of charges, then a Towne that is ſmaller by halfe, and all becauſe of her ill forme; yet becauſe there are many Townes in this Kingdome, of this forme, I have inſerted two different kind of Fortifieations for them in this Abſtract; for his Angles if you take the Angle of the Center, of the end ſide, from the Center of one of the two Cirdes of which it is compoſed, you ſhall find it of 90 degrees, but if you take it from the Center of the Paralograme it ſelf, you will find it is but of 45. degrees, and the Angle of his broad ſides is of 135. degrees, a very open and obtus Angle. This Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101578:47"/>is eaſie to be ſet out upon paper, as you may ſee by this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; but becauſe it is more difficult to ſet out in the field, when the broad ſides of it are of ſo large an extent, I will here add ſome obſervations to my former direction given in Plate 14.</p>
               <p>The beſt and the moſt ſpeedy way to ſet out ſo large a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lograme in the field, is to make choice of your Center, and to drive in a ſtake, and to faſten a line to it, of 375.<note n="*" place="margin">This line of 375 yards is the fourth part of the diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall line of the long ſide of the Paralo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grame.</note> yards, and to ſtraine it full Eaſt, and at the end of it to drive in a ſtake, then you are to wind that line about and to ſtraine it full Weſt upon a ſtrait line, and at the end of the line drive in a ſtake, &amp; theſe two laſt ſtakes will repreſent the two Centers of the two circles, from which this Paralagrame is compoſed. Then you are to ſet the ſight of your demi-circle upon the ray of 90. degrees, and to ſtand at the Eaſt circle ſtake, turning your face full Eaſt winding your demi-circle on the right hand to ſet out the South-Eaſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, the man that carieth your lines following the ray of your demi-circle till he be five hundred and thirtie<note n="*" place="margin">The ray of this line of 530 yards is the diagonall line from the center of that circle to the angle of the Paralograme.</note> yards and juſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and upon the ray, then your man that carrieth the ſtakes is to drive in a ſtake at his feet, and with a line of 100. yards, that they are to ſtraine between them, let them caſt with it, if there be juſt 530. yards from that ſtake to the Center ſtake you ſtand at, if there be juſt ſo much, then is that Angle perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet out, but if the diſtance begreater or leſſe, they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the ſtake, and amend it, you guiding them by the ſight of your demi-circle, then you are to wind your demi-circle on the left hand, to ſet out as you did this the North-Eaſt Angle; and that being ſet out and a ſtake driven in, you are to remove your ſelfe from that Eaſt circle Center ſtake, to go to the Weſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſtake, and to ſet out with your demi-circle, the South-Weſt and North-Weſt Angles, after the very ſame manner as you did the former, and two ſtakes being driven in them, the foure Angles of the Paralograme will be perfected. Then you are to ſtand with your demi-circle at the middle Center ſtake of the whole Paralograme, and after you have ſet the ſight of it upon the ray of 135. degrees, you are to turne your ſelfe full South and to try whether your South-Eaſt and North-Eaſt Angle ſtakes are juſt of 135. degrees, which being ſo, that broad ſide is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, then returne your ſelfe full North, and try whether the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101578:48"/>North-Eaſt and the North-Weſt Angle ſtakes are juſt upon 135. degrees, which if they be, then is the Paralograme perfect in all his foure Angles, then you are to ſtand at every Angle ſtake, one after another, and to faſten a line to them, of 250.<note n="*" place="margin">This Line of 250 yards is the diſtance that is to be betvveen the center of one flanker to the other center.</note> yards, and the man with the lines is to ſtraine the ſame from one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſtake to another, drive in at everie end of the line a ſtake, till he hath gone round, guiding his ſtakes with the ſight of your demi-circle, that all the ſtakes may be upon a perfect ſtrait line, then you are to faſten lines as neare the ground as may be to theſe ſtakes and to ſet many Pioniers to trace out the whole Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this Paralograme, and that being done you are to ſet out all the 18 Flankers one after another, as you were directed in the laſt Chapter.</p>

               <p>THis Square fortified by twentie foure ſmall Flanks if of 6000 yards circumference, that is three Engliſh miles and two fifth parts of a mile. It is verie convenient to fortifie a great Corporation Towne that may be redeced to that forme, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent is great, becauſe of the ſoliditie of his body, for it contains 2250000 ſquare yards. The Angle of his Center is of 90 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and it is to be ſet out in the field after the verie ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the end-ſides of the Paralograme, deſcribed in the laſt Chapter, and his Flankers are to be ſet out according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions given in Chapt. 26. and therefore to avoyd repetitions, I will omit to ſpeake of theſe things, and will only ſet forth what number of Ordnance, Foot-Souldiers, and Horſe-men, will be required to defend a place thus fortified againſt an Army of twentie thouſand men, the circumference of it being ſo great as it is.</p>

               <p>To acquaint you, that the demi-diametricall and diagonall lines of this ſuperficie are of a thouſand yards, and the whole as much more, that is an Engliſh mile, and the one tenth part of a mile, and therefore very difficult to ſet, by anie other way then by the demi-circle; the Angle of his Center is of 15. degrees, and it is compoſed of 24 Iſocele Triangles that have three ſides foure times as long as their Baſes, the Baſe containing 250. yards, and their ſides 1000 yards: the beſt and the moſt ſpeedy way then to ſet the ſame out in the field, is to drive in a ſtake in the Center of it, and to ſet out firſt of all theſe foure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, viz. the South, North, Eaſt, and Weſt Angles, for thoſe being perfectly ſet out, all the reſt will be the eaſier to be ſet out, by dividing everie quarter into five equall parts: Now how you are to ſet out theſe foure Angles, it would be ſuperfluous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, becauſe I have formerly given ſo many directions for it, and therefore I will referre you to the precedent Inſtructions ſet downe in Plate 12. and 19.

               <p>Now if any ſhould preſume to inquire the reaſons why God was pleaſed to be larger in diſpenſation of his gifts to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101578:65"/>to any of the greateſt Chriſtian Commanders, hee being but a Heathen.</p>
               <p>I anſwer; That it was his free will and pleaſure, and that it is not for us to dive into his private and unrevealed will; yet wee may ſuppoſe in all humilitie, that it was his pleaſure to inrich <hi>Caeſar</hi> with theſe unparalleld parts of the Art of war, to make him the inſtrument of the greateſt revolution that ever happened in the world; for the three former revolutions of the three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the Caldeans, Perſians, and the Greeks, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of this laſt revolution, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was the maine inſtrument of, to reduce the greateſt and moſt powerfull Common-weale that ever was, under the abſolute command of one man: And by this meanes to accompliſh the Prophecies of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> that propheſied many hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">See Daniel chap. 7. ver. 17</note> that the Roman Monarchy ſhould excell the other in might and power. We may conjecture that he was pleaſed to have the inſtrument of ſo great a work to excell all others in the Art of war, as this laſt revolution did excell the former. And wee may alſo collect by the Commentaries of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that the finger of the admirable Providence of God had the ruling of all his actions; for it is beyond humane reaſon or beleefe, that fiftie thouſand men ſhould pen up foureſcore thouſand in Alexie, and rout and defeat one hundred and foureſcore thouſand more that came to their releefe: Or overcome with a handfull of men (as he did) the great Kingdome of Aegypt, and defeat ſo many great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders joyned together in Africa and Spaine.</p>
               <p>To conclude the point, God under <hi>Caeſar</hi> was the Author of all the ſegreat actions, and ſo hee is of all our moderne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders exploits, yet wiſdome, valour, activitie, and experience in Armes, are the ſecondarie cauſes of their great atchievements; and theſe rare qualities are as much required to be in a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chiefe, that will excell others in this Art of Aſſailing, that we are to ſpeak of, as in any other eſſentiall part of the Art of war.</p>
               <p>Now ſince the erecting of ſtrong and well-lined works are but a part of the Art of defence, that will availe little, except the Governour of a Garriſon thus fortified be provident, valiant, and experienced in the practicall Art of war, to make the better uſe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:101578:66"/>of theſe works; I will in the next Chapter ſet out the charge of a prudent Governour, before I come to the particulars of the Art of Aſſailing: Becauſe this Art, and the Art of Defence, are like two inſeparable twins, that are to go hand in hand together; for it is impoſſible to aſſaile judiciouſly, except the Aſſailant be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the Art of Defence; or for a Defendent to defend a place as hee ought, except hee be verſed in the myſteries of the Art of Aſſailing, to prevent in either of them, what may bee done by the Aſſailants or Defendents.</p>

               <p n="2">2 He is to be of an approved converſation,<note place="margin">Of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> honourably incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, no ſwaggerer, nor a vanting rover, but temperate in all his actions, not over young to be ſeduced or miſſed, nor over old to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void heavineſſe, feare, and apprehenſions, infirmities, incident to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:101578:66"/>old men, but in the flower of his age from forty to threeſcore, that he may be active, provident, and vigilant, and well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all things that appertaine to his charge.</p>
               <p n="3">3 He is to be well verſed in Hiſtories, and to be adorned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his naturall parts, with divers acquired vertues and qualities, but above all, he is to have a practicall knowledge, of all the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of the Art of Warre, that he may know how to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile and to defend places, how to Martiall his men both horſe, and foot, how to advance and how to retreat, for if he hath not been preſent in great battells, in famous ſieges, in routs, in great batteries, in ſtormes, and aſſaults, he will be terrified or aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, upon any unexpected accident.</p>
               <p n="4">4 He is to be free from avarice, oppreſſion, drunkenneſſe, licentiouſneſſe, and from all impiety,<note place="margin">He is to be free from vices and adorned vvith vertue.</note> and adorned with the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite vertues to theſe vices, ſincere in Religion, and rather fervent then of the Laodicean temper; temperate and moderate, frugall and yet charitable, punctuall in his promiſes, cheriſhing valour, and puniſhing cowardice, a loving father to his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, relieving them in their need, rather then to detaine or deprive them of their pay, by wiles or colluſions.</p>

               <p n="6">6 He is to provide his Garriſon of all neceſſaries for a ſiege,<note place="margin">He is to be provident in the repaire of the vvorks of his garriſon.</note> and to repaire the Workes of it in due and in convenient time, not delaying from day to day, but preſſing the effecting of it, to the utmoſt of his power; although there be no likelihood of a ſiege, for when an enemy is at hand, it is too late to go about ſuch imployments, neither is it a ſufficient excuſe for a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſay who would have thought the enemy had a deſign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place?</p>
               <p n="7">

For if the towne be loſt by theſe defects, the blame will onely be laid upon him, and not upon the contrivers of theſe works: now becauſe the ſafety of the Towne is intruſted to his care, hee ought not to indure that ignorant Shop-keepers bee choſen Sub-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of the Workes of a Garriſon, for theſe places belong more properly to the wiſe, and prudent Gentlemen of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to the moſt experienced Officers of the Garriſon, then to ſuch men as theſe that will precipitate their owne ruine, rather then they will be croſt in their deſtructive waies.</p>
               <p n="8">8 He is to diſpoſe of all the Functions of Warre,<note place="margin">He is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all the functions of vvar, and not to meddle vvith politike affaires.</note> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand abſolutely over Horſe and Foot, or otherwiſe, he is but a titularie Governour, and it is no wonder if divers of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are plundered daily, by the incurſions of the Enemies Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, ſince he that ſhould ſend out parties to curb and reſtraine theſe diſorders, hath his hands tied. In all things, without order, nothing can be ſucceſſefull: for a Governour to anticipate upon the prerogative of Committees, and be medling in civill and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike affaires, it is to go againſt order; or for Committees to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate and be medling with thoſe things that belong properly to a Governours place, as to command over a Colonell of Horſe,<note place="margin">Committees are not to meddle in vvarlike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, onely in civill and politique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</note> and to ſend out parties at randome; it is againſt order, and againſt the rules of war; for Committees ſhould not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the defects, errours, and omiſſions of martiall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes; nor the Governour be anſwerable for any diſmeanour committed, or dutie omitted, in civill or politike affaires; but everie one ſhould be anſwerable for ſuch things that belong to their places. Therefore if a Countie bee daily moleſted by the incurſions of the Enemies Garriſons, the Governour ſhould be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101578:67"/>anſwerable to the State for his neglect and careleſneſſe in this caſe, becauſe the protection and preſervation of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie depends upon his charge. On the other ſide, if the men of war of ſuch a Countie be not duly paid, and notwithſtanding the Countie is oppreſſed, the Committees are anſwerable to the State for this omiſſion and diſmeniour. But by the common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order there is in the greater part of our Counties, betweene the Committees and the Governours of the head Garriſons, by the anticipation they do upon one anothers charges, the State knowes not whom to call to accompt for divers groſſe abuſes that are daily committed, under which divers Counties groane, and become deſolate. In a word, there is no wiſdome nor policie to ſuffer the Committee to manage, or to diſpoſe of the deſignes of war; or to ſuffer the Governours to raiſe contributions for their owne Garriſons pay, or to meddle in any manner of way in civill or politike affaires, except it be to decide ſome differences that may befall between ſome Souldiers, and ſome of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
               <p n="9">9 He is to obſerve an auſtere militarie diſcipline, and to ſuffer none of the Inhabitants to be wronged and abuſed by any of the Souldiers of the Garriſon; for if hee give them an inch this way, they will take a foot; and of the two, hee is rather to take the part of the Inhabitants then of the Souldiers, becauſe the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are moſt commonly the firſt Aggreſſours:<note place="margin">He is to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere in the Militarie Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and juſt in his judgment.</note> Yet for feare this rule ſhould not be generall, hee is to examine the caſe, and to diſtribute juſtice impartially. Hee is alſo to traine his Souldiers everie week, and withall to command the Sargeant of everie Company to inſtruct them daily, when their Company enters in guard, and eſpecially the youngeſt and raweſt Souldiers, how they ſhould manage their muskets and pikes, that they may be the more perfect when they traine before him, in the handling of their Armes. And for the Horſe, when they are at home, once a fortnight he is to appoint their Colonel a place in the field near the walls, where he is to be himſelfe, to ſee them exerciſe, by dividing their Regiment in two equal parts;<note place="margin">He is to be carefull and preſent at all militarie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</note> the Colonel commanding one partie, and the Lievtenant-Colonell the other; the one being the Aſſailants, and the other the Defendents. And in all theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes the Governour is to take exact notice both of the Horſe and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101578:68"/>Foot, that are defective in their horſes, armes, and apparell, and to cenſure them ſeverely for the firſt time, and to paniſh them the next training day if theſe defects be not amended.</p>
               <p n="10">10 He is to be active and vigilant, that Centinells be placed and relieved punctually at their hours, and to over-ſee the Courts of Guards everie night, not relying altogether upon his Major, for two eye-witneſſes are better then one; the French, whoſe Garriſons are not ordinarily above one Engliſh mile, and halfe circumference,<note place="margin">Of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Courts of Guard.</note> content themſelves with ſix Courts of Guards, the greateſt in the Market-place of 120. men, foure more at the foure gates of 60. men a piece, and one before the Governours lodging of twenty men. and by this calculation there is to be in that Garriſon 1140. Foot-ſouldiers, of which 380. are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into guard every night, that they might have two dayes reſpit in three. Their Centinells or Centries are relieved in the night time everie houre, and in the day time every two houres, and they place at everie 200. yards diſtance a Centry,<note place="margin">Of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells.</note> if their Garriſons be fortified by Baſtions, they place beſides the above-ſaid Centries, three upon everie Baſtion, one at the point of it, and two at the two ends of the faces, next to the flanks, ſo that this place of ſo ſmal a Circumference is to have forty Centries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved every hour in the night times, beſides them that are to make the Rounds, that are to be done three times everie night, beſides a private Round called by the French <hi>La Patronille,</hi> every Round is to have a principall<note n="*" place="margin">The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to go the Rounds, but the day &amp; houre of his going is to be kept private. Of the Rounds, and of the French Patronille.</note> Officer, their number is commonly of 12. and this private Round of as many, it marcheth commonly in the dead time of the night, that is an houre before day, the moſt dangerous time for ſurprizes. By this calculation the Reader may ſee that the greater part of our Garriſons are not halfe manned as they ſhould be; for I know ſome of three Engliſh miles and halfe circumference, that have not a thouſand Foot-ſouldiers, and a place of this extent ſhould have at leaſt ten or twelve Courts of Guards, whether it hath ſo many gates or no; for where the diſtance between two gates are over great, there is a Court of Guard to be erected in the midſt, to prevent a ſurprize by ſcaling.</p>
               <p n="11">11 He is to have care to ſee his Garriſon provided with Ordnance, Armes, Balls, Ammunition, Fire-works, ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101578:68"/>made, and ſtore of materials ready to make more,<note place="margin">Of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Ammunition of a Garriſon.</note> and with all manner of Engins of war, as Manttlelets and Ladders, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes, Pioniers tooles, ſtore of timber, of wooll-pacles, pitch, oyle, Brimſtone, coale for powder, pit-coale, and wood for ſewell; and hay, ſtraw, oats, and peaſe for the Horſe.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould here relate the number and quantitie of theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, that the Italians, French, and Hollanders uſe to provide their Garriſons withall, it would ſeeme to many a falſe, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible relation; and therefore I will paſſe them over, and will only ſpeak of a verie meane proportion, fitted according to our abilitie, after I have given you a hint of the ſtore of the Citadell of Milan. The Citadell of Milan is a perfect Sexagon, fortified by ſix Baſtions with Orillons, as in Plate 12. The Circumference of it cannot be at the moſt above an Engliſh mile and a quarter, and yet it had in my time 160 Cannons and Demi-Cannons in the Magazines, beſides thoſe that were placed in the paints, faces, and Flanks of the Baſtions, that were above 90 in number, and in all 250 at the leaſt, and fiftie thouſand iron bullets of all ſorts, and two hundred thouſand weight of powder, and victualied for a yeare for three thouſand men, and with Armes and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries proportionable, and ſuch proviſions will ſeeme (as I have ſaid) incredible.</p>
               <p>But the meaneſt proportion allowed for forraine Garriſons is of fiftie Peeces of Ordnance, for a Towne of two Engliſh miles circumference, of theſe ſorts, ſix Cannons, ſix Demi-Cannons, ſix long<note n="*" place="margin">If it be a Sea-tovvne you are to double the number of the long Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins, and to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But it were well if one of our Garriſons of three or foure miles circumference were thus provided: for Armes there are to be of all ſorts as many in the Magizines, as there is Souldiers in the Garriſon; and for balls, the leaſt number that can be provided, is for Cannon-balls, Demi-Cannons, and long Culverins, ſix hundred a piece, that is 1800 of theſe three ſorts, and 2000 balls for the Secres, and 1200 for the Drakes, and fiftie new Carriages of all ſorts in the Magazine, that if any Peece of Ordnance be diſmouned, it may preſently be let up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and twentie lye thouſand weight of match, five hundred Granado's, and 100 great oues for Maſter-peeces, and as many
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:101578:69"/>materialls to make twice as many more, and of all other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſpoken of before proportionably.</p>
               <p n="12">12 He is to have a provident fore-caſt to provide in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his Garriſon with all manner of victualls, and malt, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the ſtrong Workes of the Garriſon, the number nor the valour of the Souldiers, nor this ſtore of Cannons, Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and Armes, Granadoes, and other neceſſaries will availe nothing, if the Garriſon be diſtreſſed for want of victualls, for all theſe things will but inrich the Enemy, when by famine the Towne ſhall bee inforced to yeeld to the Enemies mercy.</p>
               <p>The two moſt neceſſarie proviſions,<note place="margin">He is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vvith all manner of proviſions and victuals.</note> are bread and beere, and therefore the Governour is to take an exact accompt of the number of men, women and children, there is in his Garriſon, I meane with the Foot and Horſe-men of the Garriſon, that I will ſuppoſe to be ten thouſand living ſoules. The leaſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of bread and beere that can be given, is of a pound of bread and a pottle of beere a day, now everie ſtrike, or buſhell of Corn, will yeeld, 56. pound weight of bread, and this will amount to 188 ſtrike a day, and in three months to 16920. ſtrike of wheat, that is 2115. quarters of wheat. And as for beere, everie barrell of beere containes 36. gallons, and every quarter of malt will make eight barrells of ſmall beere, that containes 576 pottles of beer; ſo that after this rate there will be ſpent 17. quarters and halfe of malt in a day, but we will allow 18 quarters for the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers mornings-draught, that will amount in three moneths to 1620. quarters of malt.</p>
               <p>The ſalt is the next, for without ſalt a Garriſon cannot ſubſiſt, and therefore one hundred quarters of ſalt is the leaſt that can be provided for three months. Butter and Cheeſe are the next, and ten thouſand weight of each is of the leaſt, and a thouſand barrells of Porke, and of ſalt Beefe, is little enough, beſides a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fliches of Bacon, five hundred quarters of white Peaſe, two thouſand weight of Rice, twenty tun of Vinegar, for it is uſefull to coole the pieces of Ordnance when they are over-heated; three or foure tun of oyle, great ſtore of timber and fewell, and eſpecially of bruſh bavins, for to repaire breaches, good ſtore of ſugar, and ſpices, but ſpecially all manner of Phyſicall drugs, for ſick and wounded men, and ſtore of Chyrurgions to dreſſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101578:69"/>the wounded ſouldiers: All theſe things and manie more, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Governour will have a care to provide his Garriſon withall, if he intend to make a noble reſiſtance, and to preſerve his Garrriſon, life, honour, and reputation. But divers will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that the providing of theſe things belongeth to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, and not to the Governours. I anſwer, that it belongeth to the Governours in forraine parts, and that he is bound by his place, after he hath twice or thrice admoniſhed them, to provide theſe things, and they do it not, to proteſt againſt them, and to acquaint the State of their neglect, and omiſſion of it, otherwiſe if the Town be loſt by the want of anie of theſe things, the blame will be imputed onely to the improvidency of the Governour. Moreover<note n="*" place="margin">The dutie of a Governour to prevent ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes and ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> he is to be verie vigilant, to prevent ſurpriſes, by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes, that may lye undiſcovered in allowes neare to a gate, that may of a ſudden ſlay the Centeries, force a Court of Guard, and take a towne; or by ſcaling in the night time, for it is a thing eaſie to be done, to ſcale Workes that are ſo low as ours. To prevent theſe ſurpriſes, and ſcaling, the Governour is to ſend out every night 24. horſe divided into foure parties of ſix a piece, and theſe parties muſt range all the principall rodes that lead to his Garriſon, for the diſtance of ſeaven or eight mile everie way, as South, North, Eaſt and Weſt, and to cauſe at the break of day all hollowes, and old walls about the towne to be viewed by two ſouldiers of everie gate, that are to be put forth at the Sally-ports, and to come in againe before the gates be open, and their draw-bridge put down, and by theſe two meanes the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour will preſelve his Garriſon from ſcaling and ſurpriſes.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:101578:70"/>the motion and diſguiſed then ſelves in Gentlewomens apparell, ryding behind ſix Gentlemen, that lived neare that Garriſon, everie horſe-man having at his ſide a young valiant ſouldier, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed like Lacquie's that made up eighteen in all, having piſtolls in their pockets, and coming to the gate of the Garriſon, he that rid formoſt carried behind him the undertaker diſguiſed like a Gentlewoman, the Set jeant of the Court of Guard began to examine where they went: we come (ſaith the firſt horſe-man) to be merrie in the Towne, with theſe Gentlewomen our kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, whereupon he let them paſſe, but being come between the two gates, where the Portcullice was, the firſt Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fained to be ready to ſwound, and called to ſome of the Court of guard for help, they as officious men came all to aſſiſt the ſicke Gentlewoman, whereupon they all lighted, and the Lacquie's did inſtantly run to the Court of guard, and brought all the Partiſans and Halberts they could lay hold on, and the Gentlemen and Gentlewomen drew out their piſtolls, and ſlew everie one of them a fouldier of the Court of guard, and made good the gate till their Ambuſcado that was within a musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot of the towne in a hollow came to their reliefe, and ſo took this garriſon that was ſtrong and of great concernment. The laſt Stratagem is knowne of all men, for it is the ſurpriſing of Hereford, that was as neatly carried as any of the former, for he that played the Conſtables part, was certainly a valiant Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for it was a great attempt to venture upon ſo ſtrong and ſo well manned a garriſon as that was;<note place="margin">The third vvay is by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie.</note> The third way was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Parthians to famiſh <hi>Craſſus</hi>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:101578:71"/>that did not obey this Proclamation, within fifteen daies, were inforced to obey the ſame by a partie of 2000, horſe that were ſent by the King to ſee the execution of it, whereby the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was reduced within a moneth after, to ſuch extreame want of victualls, and of provender for his horſes, that he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to raiſe his ſiege with the loſſe of his former reputation, and of 30000. of his men that periſhed by famine, and by the ſword upon their retreat into Italy.</p>
               <p>This policie may be uſed alſo to reduce the ſtrongeſt Garriſon that can be, if the partie be maſter of the field, or lye in an intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Camp ſome twentie miles off, that hee may day and night ſcoure all the roads with ſtrong parties of Horſe, as the Deke <hi>de Montmorency</hi> did; for after the favour of God, it was the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie cauſe of the preſervation of the Kingdome of Frances for if the French King had enforced the Emperour to a pitcht battell, and that he had been routed, the Emperours Army had advinced without oppoſition to the verie gates of Paris, becauſe there was not in thoſe dayes any ſtrong hold between Marſeilles and Paris. But by this meanes the French King did not hazard his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome upon the caſuall event of a battell, and yet preſerved the ſame, and did utterly waſte and reduce to nothing, the greateſt Army that ever this Emperour was Maſter of, and that was led by the moſt experienced Commanders in Chriſtendome.<note place="margin">The fourth vvay is by ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the night time.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth way is by ſcaling in the night time, as Geneva was likely to have been taken by the Lord <hi>D'Aulbigny,</hi> Generall for the Duke of Savoy in <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths dayes;<note n="*" place="margin">The beſt vvay for a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to prevent theſe ſurpriſes by ſtratagems of VVarre and ſcaling, is ſet out in Chap. 32.</note> for there were above five hundred men gotten up upon the Rampiers before they were diſcovered; and had it not been by the favour of God, that one of the firſt Inhabitants that was alarmed, did run to the lower Flanks of one of their Baſtions, that had two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons mounted, pointed and charged with caſe and chaine-ſhot, and preſently fired them, whereby all the Aſſailants ſcaling lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were broken, and caſt into the dike, the Citie had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but the Souldiers and the Inhabitants being aſſured by this meanes, that no greater number then was entred could annoy them, took courage, and put the greater part of them to the ſword, ſome Lords excepted, that they cauſed to be beheaded the ſame day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:101578:71"/>And this is the reaſon that I have preſſed ſo much in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſcourſes of the practicall Art of Fortification, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie there is to erect upper and lower Flanks, as the only meanes to preſerve a ſtrong hold from ſcaling in the night time, and from caſting of galleries over the mote or dike, to prevent a generall aſſault; for theſe Flanks (under God) were the cauſe, not only of the preſervation of Geneva, but of Caſal in Italy ſome certaine yeares ſince; for the French<note n="*" place="margin">He vvas the verie ſame that vvas Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Iſle of Ree, called Monſieur de Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax.</note> Governour that was entruſted by the Duke of Mantua to defend that ſtrong hold againſt an Army of thirtie thouſand men, commanded by the Marquiſſe <hi>Spinola,</hi> did make ſuch uſe of the lower Flanks of the Baſtions of that Garriſon, that he broke three times one after another, the ſtrong galleries that the ſaid Marquiſſe did caſt over the mote, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him by that meanes to come to a generall aſſault, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him to raiſe his ſiege, which diſgrace ſtruck ſuch a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the heart of the Marquiſſe, that he died ſhortly after, more of griefe then by the violence of his diſeaſe, holding and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting that it was a great blemiſh to his former reputation, to be beaten off by ſo young a Governour, from a ſiege, when hee had been reputed the moſt experienced Commander in Chriſtendom, in the Art of Aſſailing.</p>
               <p>The fifth way is by the blocking up of a Garriſon at a certaine diſtance, by ſtrong Forts, or ſtrong houſes, ſeated and erected by,<note n="*" place="margin">The fifth vvay is by the blocking up of a Garriſon at a certaine diſtance.</note> or neare the ſaid Garriſon. This way is tedious and uncertaine, becauſe ſuch ancient houſes are rarely ſeated in the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places, or at an equall diſtance for that purpoſe, and by theſe defects, the reducing of the Garriſon is much retarded; for the beſieged receive ordinarily ſome releefe from the adjacent villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. It were therefore ſafer for a Generall, if hee be reſolved to reduce a Garriſon this way, to erect foure new Forts, on the South, North, Eaſt, and Weſt of that Towne, upon the moſt convenient ſeats that can be found, within no longer diſtance then a mile, of all ſides from that Garriſon; and are to be ſeated where they may moſt conveniently command and block up the roads that lead to that Garriſon. The continent of theſe Forts are to containe foure hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe, and from<note n="*" place="margin">The lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of theſe Forts are to be lovv and slight, ſo they be kept drie, for it matters not ſo they maie laſt halfe a yeare.</note> Fort to Fort, a ſmall Line of Communication is to be drawne, with a dike of ſix foot deep, and nine foot broad.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:101578:72"/>And if there be a River running thorow, or by one ſide of that Garriſon, two woodden bridges are to be erected, either with boats, or with piles, and two good Redouts erected to defend theſe bridges. And all this may be done in leſſe then a months time, by an Army that is eight thouſand Foot ſtrong, and two thouſand Horſe, ſo it be Maſter of the field: And this courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken about the latter end of October, this Garriſon will be in ſuch ſtreights for victuals and Ammunition before March, that it will be enforced to yeeld to the mercie of the Aſſailants: for it cannot be releeved, but by a greater partie by halfe then are bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letted in theſe foure Forts and two Redouts, becauſe they releeve and joyne one with another upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>The ſixth and the moſt certaine and method-like way,<note place="margin">The ſixth and the ſureſt vvay is by a do able intrenched Camp.</note> is by an intrenched Camp uſed in <hi>Caeſars</hi> dayes, and at this time in Flanders by the French and Hollanders; becauſe if all the five former wayes having been attempted and faile, this will aſſuredly carrie away the Garriſon, either by ſtorme or famine.

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Of the opinions of experienced Commanders, concerning ſallies made by the Defendants at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Siege.</head>
               <p>ALL our moderne Commanders do not agree in this point, for ſome would have no<note n="*" place="margin">Whether it be beſt to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, or not to ſallie, in the beginning of a Siege.</note> ſallies at all, till the Aſſailant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to pierce the Counterſcarp with their ſecret approaches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would maintaine the ſouldiers of the Garriſon in their full number and ſtrength, for the moſt urgent occaſion of defence, that is, when the enemies do indervour to caſt their galleries o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the mote, and to make their Mines for to come to a generall
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101578:72"/>aſſault: their reaſons are theſe. 1. All the ſallyes of a Garriſon ſay they, cannot hinder an Aſſailant Army to perform eight of the ten operations, that ſhall be ſpoken of in the next Chapter. 2. If it be never ſo well manned, the Aſſailants are alwayes ſive to one at leaſt, and ſometime ten for one; and therfore if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants in theſe ſallyes loſe one man, their loſſe is greater, then if the Aſſailants loſe five; nay, more then ten, becauſe they may be ſupplyed and recruted: but the Defendants cannot, but by the coming of a great Army to their releife. 3. When the Defendants ſally ſo farre from their Rampiars, as to endeavour to impede the incamping of the Aſſailants, or the making of their firſt approaches; it is ten to one ſay they, if they be not beaten and driven in again with loſſe.<note n="*" place="margin">Forces that ſally out are ſubject to be routed, if a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants horſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between them and the town.</note> Nay, they may be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly routed, and their retreat into the town ſtopped; if a good party of horſe of the Aſſailants, can get between their Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piars and them: which if they doe, as it hath been oftentimes effected; the ſtrength and the courage of the Defendants is much weakned, and the town in a manner halfe reduced. Therefore ſay they, it is ſafer, and a part of greater wiſdome for a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to keep in his men till the Aſſailants are near the <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> that their retreat may be ſecured by their muſquet ſhot, from the <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> and from the Ordnance of the Baſtions and rampiars. But if in caſe the Garriſon is not ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manned, they are not ſay they, to make any ſallyes at all; but only to diſcharge now and then ſome Culverings ſhot when ſome of the Aſſailants horſe are in a body, and in the reach of the ſhot; or to diſcharge a Drake or two when they ſee ſome Commander of quality come neare to view their Out-works: for ſuch expences are not alwayes caſt away, for many great Commanders have been ſlain after this manner; and among the reſt the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>

<list>
                     <item>1. That if a Garriſon doe keep within their Rampiars, and make no ſallies at all, that the Aſſailants are incouraged by it; and ſuppoſe the town to be weakly manned, or ill provided of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:101578:73"/>Ammunition, if they be not laviſh of their powder, in ſhooting dayly their Culverins, to hinder with ſhot the aſſailants ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</item>
                     <item>2. They ſay that if the Defendants doe not endeavour to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede by ſallyes their approaches, before they come to pierce their <hi>Contreeſcarpe;</hi> that their ſallies will be then to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe they may be ſo ſuddenly begerted, that they will not then be able to ſally forth at all.</item>
                     <item>3. That to gain time, which is more precious in ſieges then to any other occaſions of warre, becauſe they hope to be relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſome party of theirs, if they can hold out but a certaine time, that the defendants are by their dayly ſallyes, to hinder the Aſſailants approaches; and to the utmoſt of their power, to impede them, to break through their <hi>Contre eſcarpe:</hi> for if they can but buſie them three weeks or a months time, about theſe operations, it will much diſhearten the common ſculdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and diſcourage the Commanders of the Aſſailants Army.</item>

                  <hi>Petro Sardy,</hi> and the greater part of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Commanders, ſide in their judgement, with the firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion here related; and that I conceive it alſo to be the ſafeſt way, and eſpecially in this civill warre of ours; in which, our Garriſons are ſo ill manned, and ſo ill provided with Ordnance and Ammunition. And alſo, becauſe we have neither Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, nor <hi>Contre eſcarpe,</hi> and not ſo much as any lower flunks to ſcoure our Courtines, or ditches; and therefore our works being ſo weak and deformed, as the greater part are, we are to keep our men freſh and in heart, for the defence of a generall aſſault. Beſides, raw, and unexperienced ſouldiers, that never were in beſieged Townes, are mightily aſtoniſhed and amazed, at the firſt approach of a great Army before their Rampiars; but when they have been wonted to look the enemy in the face, their courage and reſolution is increaſed, and dare better attempt ſuch ſallyes then they could at the firſt coming. And to prevent this Panique feare,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Plutarc.</hi> in <hi>Marius</hi> life.</note> 
                  <hi>Marius</hi> a great Commander of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Romans, being appointed by the Senate to raiſe an Army to hinder the <hi>Cymbers,</hi> a barbarous nation, that was coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Italy,</hi> to paſſe the <hi>Alpelins</hi> Mounts, for they were already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in <hi>Lombardia;</hi> he ſeeing that the greater part of his Army did conſiſt of raw ſouldiers, he cauſed them to lye in an intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Camp every night, but when he came in ſight of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, their multitude, their grim countenance, their high ſtature, and barbarous carriage, and apparell, did ſo affright his ſouldiers, that he could hardly make them defend the Rampiars of their Camp; whereupon he gave charge to his Officers, to make one Regiment after another, to be day and night upon the Rampi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, that they might be wonted to ſee without feare, this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and grim nation; and lay purpoſely near a month, in one and the ſame intrenched Camp, ſuffering the enemies to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſometimes to the very brim of the ditch, till he ſaw his ſouldiers freed of this Panique feare; and till they came and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to iſſue forth of their Camp, to give the enemy bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, which he granted with much adoe, reproving them for their former feare and cowardice. And by this wiſe Policy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a famous victory, for there remained ſlain in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, foureſcore thouſand in the field of the <hi>Cymbers,</hi> and very few of the <hi>Romans.</hi> But had he ſet upon them at the firſt, when his Army was amazed, he had undoubtedly been routed; and had caſt the City of <hi>Rome</hi> into a great danger, for they had then no other Army ready to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, it is moſt certain that the Aſſailants in this unnaturall warre of ours, are to come to a ſtorme the very next day that their Army hath faced a Garriſon, if the works of it be not regulary, or have no lower flanks; and their breſt-work not above nine foot high, and ſix or ſeven foot thick, with a graft of ſome nine foot deep, and twenty foot broad; for if they have but courage, they will undoubtedly take the ſame. And for the Defendants, they are not to waſt their men, and Ammunition, in ridiculous ſallyes, but to bee watchfull, and valiant to oppoſe the aſſailants in a generall ſtorme: for if they can beat them off twice or thrice, they will free themſelves from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ury. But if the works of a Garriſon be regulary, and lined out according to Art, and well flanked with upper and lower flanks, having the Rampiars and Breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of Cannon proof, and twenty or thirty foot high, with
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101578:74"/>a graft of twenty foot deep, and forty foot broad, beſides the ſmall ditch called <hi>La cunette:</hi> with a good <hi>Contre eſcarpe:</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a breſt-work of ſix foot high, with a foot-ſtep going round about the inward work, and well manned and provided with Ordnance and Ammunition; then is the Generall or Commander in chiefe that undertakes to beſiege ſuch a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to intrench himſelf in ſuch an intrenched Camp, that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated in Plate 24. and by degrees to make his approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches both open and private, to break into the <hi>Contre eſcarpe;</hi> and to beat to duſt the defendants flanks by his batteries, that he may caſt his Galleries over the mote: and ſet his Miners at work, to blow up by Mines, the Point, or Faces of the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to come to a generall aſſault; for otherwiſe he will but ſpin out the time, and at laſt, come off with little honour and reputation.</p>

And all theſe works were erected and perfected in leſſe then a month; for he was not in all ſix weeks before it, ſo that it may be ſuppoſed, that the interior intrenchment, or the circulary line that did begert the city round, was done in eight or ten dayes; and ſo ſufficiently made, and ſo vigilantly guarded, that the beſieged could never break through theſe works, to joyn with them that came to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101578:75"/>Nor that great Army could not alſo goe over theſe works, but tired themſelves in endeavouring to break through. And being thus over-tired, <hi>Caeſar</hi> made a ſally with his freſh Army, and by theſe means routed them, and obtained the city, that yeelded to his mercy, being not able to hold out for want of victuals. By this unparalleld example it is apparent, that there is no way to this to reduce a ſtrong hold, and to be able to oppoſe a potent Army that cometh purpoſely to relieve it, when it is beſieged.</p>
               <p>But to return where I left, theſe foure quarters being ſet out and finiſhed, and the Huts or Tents being ſet up, and the horſe and foot with the Carriages, and the Train of Artillery being placed, and the Generalls Tents being erected in the midſt of one of the beſt ſeated quarters, a double line<note n="*" place="margin">The ſecond operation.</note> of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation marked <hi>C.</hi> is to be lined and taken in hand; having in every ſide ſmal flankers as it is demonſtrated, to ſecure the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red way, made between the two Rampiars, markt by the letter <hi>M.</hi> whereby one quarter may releive the other as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, without danger. Now if a deep and unfordable river run in the midſt, or on the ſide of this Garriſon, two bridges<note n="(a)" place="margin">The third operation.</note> are to be erected over the ſame, in the two broad ſides quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this entrenched Camp; for in that place they will be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured without any other works, and ſeated conveniently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive from both ſides the river, any of the quarters, if any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were aſſailed by the beſieged, or any partie that ſhould come to their reliefe. Theſe bridges<note n="*" place="margin">Four kind of bridges, and how they are to be erected; the firſt ſort being the beſt, and ſooneſt erected</note> are to be made with Barges, or great flat bottome boats, well linked together with iron chains, and faſtned to pilles droven in the midſt, and on both ſides of the river, that the ſtream may not drive them down; and theſe Barges or Boates, are to be covered with planks of three inches thick, and then with gravell; that Carriages and the Traine of Artillery, may paſſe over without fear. But if ſuch flat Boats nor Barges cannot be found, then they are to be erected with Pilles, and covered over with ſuch thick planks, or gravell. Or if ſeaſoned Pilles could not alſo be had, then long timber trees are to be felled, and the bark and branches being he wed away and ſquared, they are to be bound faſt together as flotts of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that are driven down a ſhallow river, where Barges cannot
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:101578:75"/>goe for want of water; and five or ſix of theſe flotts well bound together, will make a ſtrong bridge, ſo it be covered with the aforeſaid planks and gravell, and faſtned in the midſt and in the ſides to Pilles, driven with violence into the ground. Another kind of bridge may be made ſuddenly, with two double rowes of empty Sack-pipes, Hogs-heads, or Beer-barrels, well hooped,<note place="margin">See <hi>Philip</hi> the Commin.

As <hi>Charles</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>Burgundi,</hi> did erect one (over the river, the Seine that runneth through the midſt of <hi>Paris</hi>) ſome three miles from the city, and this bridge was erected in one night: And all the Dukes Army, with his Train of Artillery, bagge and baggage, paſſed the river before eight of the clock in the morning; upon which unexpected tidings, <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, the great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, was greatly amazed.</p>
               <p>This double line of communication, and theſe bridges being finiſhed, the Enginiers are to line out their approaches<note n="(b)" place="margin">The fourth operation.</note> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any of theſe two wayes demonſtrated in this Plate by the letter <hi>D.</hi> erecting at every return an Angle flanker, where Muſquettiers are placed to ſecure the approaches, having a Court of Guard in every one of them, of forty or fifty men; theſe flankers ſerve alſo for Carriages or horſe-men to retreat, when other Carriages or horſe-men are diſcovered coming in the next approaches, if in caſe the Generall will have them ſo narrow, that two Carriages cannot paſſe cloſe together, for he hath the diſpoſing of it: ſome therefore will have them but 12 foot broad, and 4 foot deep, and ſome twenty foot broad, and five foot deep; but very flat in the bottome: the ſlope of the ſides is not to be above a foot. The principall care of the Engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier that lines them out, is to ſet out their Angles ſo farre into the field on the right, and on the left hand, that they may not be as the <hi>French</hi> term it <hi>(Enfillees)</hi> that is,<note n="*" place="margin">Of the true ſetting out of approaches.</note> that any Cannon or Culvering ſhot, placed upon the the Angle or Point of any of the Baſtions of the Garriſon beſieged, may not upon a ſtrait line beat in any of the approaches; for if they may, the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are not ſafe, nor lined out as they ſhould be, but will be deſtructive to the Aſſailants; for ſuch a ſhot may indanger the lives of twenty horſe-men, or foot-men, at a time.</p>

               <p>The new batteries erected upon the Contre eſcarpe, that we ſpoke of in the laſt Chapter, marked with the letter <hi>V.</hi> in this Plate, appointed to beat, to ruine the two points of two Baſtions, are to have ſix whole Cannons mounted upon them, and pointed againſt the ſide of the face of the Baſtions, within twenty yards of the point, as the moſt convenient place, to make a ſpeedy breach, for to fill with the ruines of it the mote or ditch, theſe ſix Cannons are to be pointed,

               <p>The other two batteries alſo, marked by the letter <hi>R.</hi> are to have three or foure whole Culverings upon them, that are to be pointed againſt the flanks of theſe two baſtions, that are alſo to bee fired one after another from every ſeverall batterie, but the foure culverings upon every one of them are to bee diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and fired at one inſtant of time, as hath been formerly ſaid of the ſix Cannons.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101578:78"/>a diverſion of the Defendants forces; by which diverſion, their forces muſt of neceſſity be divided: and by conſequence weakned and diſinabled to make ſo ſtrong an oppoſition as they might doe, if there were but two breaches.</p>
               <p>The beſt way to guide covered approaches or mines, to that very place you purpoſe to doe, is to have a perfect Sea-compaſſe with you, that you may note upon your Table-book, upon what point or degree the place you intend to come to, ſtandeth; from the mouth, or opening of the covered approaches, or mine.</p>
               <p>This mouth or opening, is to be made eight or nine foot ſquare, and the bottome as deep as you intend to goe with your Mine,<note n="(k)" place="margin">The true way how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a Mine.</note> then you are to ſet your Sea-compaſſe<note n="(l)" place="margin">Sea-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to be uſed in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Mines.</note> upon the point or degree noted before, and to order the Pioniers to mine juſt upon the ray of the degree; their way is not to be, if the ground permit above four, or four foot and a half broad, and not above five, or five foot and a halfe high, that two men may conveniently paſſe with<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe hods are great baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets pointed in the bottome, and two foot broad at top, flat againſt the backs, and round without ſide; wherein a man may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry three times as much earth as in a Scut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.</note> hoddes on their backs full of the earth of the myne; that is, to be brought up from the mouth of the myne with a Ladder, and placed ſome ſixteen foot from the brim of the mouth; in manner of a ſquare breſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, as it is demonſtrated in this Plate by the letter <hi>N.</hi> the letter <hi>M.</hi> repreſenting the mouth of the myne. But this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod is to be onely obſerved, if in caſe the mouth be in the field, as the mouth of all covered approaches are; but if the mouth of the myne doth begin beyond the mote, then the earth is to be beſtowed to raiſe the banks of the ſmall intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that are made along the wall of the Rampiar.</p>
               <p>Now when the Pioniers have entred the mine ſome foure foot, you are to ſet up at the entrance of it ſuch a ſtrong doore caſe, as is marked by the letter <hi>T.</hi> having two ſtrong ledges nayled two inches and a halfe lower then the very top; and at every ſix foot of the way of the myne,<note n="(m)" place="margin">How to hold up the earth of a Mine from calving in.</note> you are to place ſuch another doore-caſe, and to ſet planks of two inches and a halfe thick upon theſe ledges ſpoken of before; and this muſt of neceſſity bee done, where you find the earth to bee apt to calve: but where it is ſound, this charge may be ſpared.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:101578:79"/>And when the way of the Mine is come ſo farre under the face of the Baſtion, as you deſire; you are then to wind the way of your Mine ten yards on the right hand, and ten yards on the left hand; in the manner of a <hi>T.</hi> as it is demonſtrated in this Plate, and to make two round Ovens of that capacity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſix or ſeven barrels of powder apeece; as it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the letter <hi>P.</hi> and when theſe barrels are placed in both Ovens, the mouth of them is to be ſtopped (after the Traine of powder to them, hath bin laid upon boards) with<note n="(n)" place="margin">All other kind of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ovens mouth, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to bricks and lyme.</note> bricks and lime, with a hole in the bottome of foure inches ſquare, for the Traine to be brought along the way of the Mine to the very mouth of it. Others make uſe of a copper pipe made like a <hi>T.</hi> in which they put a fine tinder match; the burning of which, they have made experience of, to know the juſt time that it will require to burne, to ſet the Train cloſe to the powder barrels on fire, and do ſet the other end towards the mouth of the Mine on fire, ſo many houres before the time they intend to ſpring the Mine; the other way by a Train upon boards to the very mouth of the Mine is to be fired with a lighted match, faſtned to the end of a long kane; and he that fireth the ſame, is to run aſide as farre as he can, to avoyd the danger of the ſplits of the Mine.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Mines being ſprung at the ſame time, that the breaches of the Cannon batteries are ready for a generall aſſault, will produce a great amazement, or a panique feare among the Defendants. And upon this amazement, the Regiments that are appointed to attempt every one of theſe ſeverall breaches, are to be ready, and to advance furiouſly<note n="(o)" place="margin">The tenth and laſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and reduce a Garriſon Town.</note> forward to enter the breach; for to crowne their heads with the Crown of Lawrell, due to the Victors. But becauſe moſt of our ſouldiers goe not armed as they ſhould, for ſuch a dangerous and deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, I will here deſcribe the Arms, that a wiſe Generall, that holds the lives of his ſouldiers more precious to him then his own, ſhould have alwayes ready to preſerve ſuch valorous ſouldiers, that lead the way to ſuch a Feaſt; he is I ſay to have alwayes one hundred of breſt-plates, and one hundred of head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeces, and one hundred of Roudaches, or broad Targets of musket proofe, to diſpoſe among thoſe that undertake to lead
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101578:79"/>the Front of the three firſt ranks that enter theſe breaches, and this would preſerve many mens lives, and make them goe on more boldly to ſo dangerous a fight.</p>
               <p>In the next place we are to ſuppoſe that the Aſſailants by their valour have entred the breaches, and obtained the points of the Baſtions, and other the top of the Rampiars; and yet cannot enter the towne, becauſe of the provident fore-caſt of the Defendants, that have intrenched themſelves between the town and their Rampiars, and overthwart the breſt of the Baſtions: yet the Aſſailants are not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, but preſently caſt up ſome ſmall trenches upon the Rampiars, and the points of the Baſtions they have taken, till their ſmalleſt Sacres and Drakes be drawn up upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piars, and the points of the Baſtions, that will ſpeedily beat the Defendants from their weak intrenchments, and inforce them to a parley, having then no other meanes left to preſerve their lives but that; for if they be forced by another ſtorme, they are like to ſuffer all the miſeries that a provoked and incenſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, will be able to inflict upon them.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that the Aſſailants be repulſed with great loſſe from the firſt and ſecond Aſſault, yet if the Generall can beare theſe loſſes patiently, being intrenched in ſuch a manner as is afore ſaid; he may reduce in few dayes this obſtinate Garriſon, and obtaine the Crown of Lawrell, due to ſuch as are conſtant in their warlike attempts, by famine, that inforceth the greateſt reſolution, to an accommodation. For if he can but endure the irkſome and tedious labour of a long ſiege, this Garriſon not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this great reſolution, can hope for no reliefe. For if a greater Army then his come to endeavour to raiſe the ſiege, it cannot force this intrenched Camp, nor inforce him to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, except he liſt himſelfe, or that ſome apparent occaſion of prevailing ſhould be offered; as the wearineſſe of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> did induce <hi>Caeſar</hi> to ſally out of his intrenched Camp, after they had tired themſelves upon their vain attempt,<note place="margin">See <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaties <hi>lib.</hi> 7.</note> ſo break through his ſtrong Rampiars and intrenchments, otherwiſe it would be no wiſdome for a Generall to embrace an uncertain enterpriſe, for a certain victory, that cannot be taken out of his hands,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101578:80"/>if he continue in his intrenched Camp; for at laſt that Garriſon will be inforced to yield to his mercy, as the City of <hi>Alexie</hi> was conſtrained to ſubmit to <hi>Caeſars</hi> clemency.</p>
               <p>Having fully ſhewn the endeavonrs and the valour of the Aſſailants, it remaines for the concluſion of this point, and of this abſtract, to ſhew alſo the endeavours that a valiant and prudent Governour is to perform, to diſcharge with a good conſcience the great truſt that hath been repoſed upon him, for the defence of ſuch a Garriſon. Firſt, as the Aſſailants erect their batteries, and point their Cannons to beat down the breſt-works of the flanks, and of the Rampiars; he is to indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to hinder the raiſing of theſe batteries, or to diſ ount their Cannons by placing the greateſt pieces he hath, upon the Mounts or Cavalliers that are erected near to the middle of the Courtines of his Garriſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is to have great care to cauſe the breſt-works of the Flanks, or of the Rampiars, that have been beaten down in the day time to be repaired in the night; cauſing women and children to bring earth in the day near unto the places of the greateſt breaches,<note place="margin">The ten oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> that may with the more ſpeed be repaired, having alwayes many hoppes and wool-ſacks in a readineſſe to ſerve as breſt-works upon the breaches of the Rampiars, and of the Bulwarks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is to charge the Inhabitants to bring ſtore of ſewel and their greateſt Caldrons, or Kittles to the houſes adjacent, to the Rampiars, and to command that ſtore of oyle, and water may be in a readineſſe: that in the time of the generall aſſault, ſires may be kindled near to the Rampiars; and oyle and water heated boyling hot in theſe Cauldrons and K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttles, to be thrown by the women upon the Aſſailants that endeavour to ſcale the Rampiars.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He is to have great ſtore of all manner of fire-works ready to caſt upon thoſe that endeavour to enter the breaches, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may and offend the aſſailants, placing many muskettiers on both ſides of the breaches, that may g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll the aſſailants in the flanks.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He is to have in the Magazine of his Garriſon, one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Sea-Muskets, that the French call <hi>Harquebus à Groch,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:101578:80"/>that carry a bullet three times as great as an ordinary Muſquet, and longer then they by halfe a yard, and one hundred of Roudaches, or iron targets of Muſquet proofe, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Partiſans, and as many good Halberds, with a hundred of breaſt-plates, and as many head-pieces, all of them of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquet ſhot proofe: and all theſe are to be diſpoſed to the moſt valiant ſoldiers of the Garriſon, that dare undertake to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the breaches.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As ſoone as he perceiveth that the aſſailants erect their batteries, he may preſently gueſſe where they intend to make the breaches; then is he to take order, to erect by times new intrenchments, for it is too late to goe about them, when the aſſailants have gotten the rampiars, and the points of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When the Aſſailants begin their Mines, he is diligently to ſearch the place where they intend to carry their mine; and becauſe they ſeeme ſometime to goe one way, when they intend to goe another, to delude the defendants, he is to try in all places that he may miſtruſt they intend to goe with their Mines, theſe concluſions:</p>
               <p>Let a very thinne Barbers baſon be ſet to that place that is ſuſpected, full of cleare water; If the Aſſailants mine in that place, at every ſtroke of their pick-axes, the water in the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will frizzle into ſmall round circles, as if a ſmall ſtone were caſt in a paile of water.</p>
               <p>Or let a drumme be ſet downe to the place, and ſome very round white peaſe be ſet upon the top of the drumme, and theſe peaſe will leap at every ſtroke of the aſſailants pick-axes, if they be mining in that place. And if any of theſe ſymptomes appeare, then is he ſuddenly to ſet Pioniers at work, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and to give aire or vent to the aſſailants mines; and when the defendants Pioniers come neare their Mine, let them proceed no farther, but let the Centries that are neare the place, where the mouth of the aſſailants mine is, give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from time to time, if any barrells of powder be brought into the ovens of the Aſſailants mine; for before they can ſire the ſame, the defendants may if they be vigilant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101578:81"/>them of their powder, and all's under one, give vent to their Mine. This ſtratagem hath been ſucceſſefull to divers defendants.</p>
               <p n="8">8. When the aſſailants endeavour to carry over their galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the mote, he is then to ſpare no paines to place Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquetiers on their flanks to impede them; but if in caſe they are covered from the Muſquet ſhot by mantlets, he is then to have the Demy-cannons placed in the lower flanks of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, to be ſuddenly charged with iron balls, (and the caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot wherewith they were charged before, removed, that as ſoone as the aſſailants galleries are almoſt brought over) the ſhot of theſe two Demi-cannons may break them to pieces.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Demi-cannons that are placed in the upper flanks, are to be charged with chaine ſhot, that is, with two iron balls linked together by an iron chaine, that when the generall aſſault is given, if in caſe the aſſailants ſhould attempt to ſcale the Rampiars, the ſaid chained balls might caſt downe all their ſcaling ladders.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And laſtly, the Governour during the ſiege is to double his Courts of Guards, and Centries, and to goe the Rounds oftentimes himſelfe, and in the day of a generall aſſault, he is to goe to all places, and to view the defects, and to apply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to them, ſending ſudden reliefe to thoſe breaches that are in moſt danger to be entred, and to have alwayes about him, ſome three ſcore of the moſt valiant ſoldiers of the Garriſon, being in the head of them, to relieve the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed place of the Garriſon: and by theſe and ſuch like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of valour and fidelity, he is to diſcharge the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him, and preſerve his Garriſon, if it be poſſible.</p>
